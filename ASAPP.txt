# ASAPP Docs

## Docs

- [Check for spelling mistakes](https://docs.asapp.com/apis/autocompose/check-for-spelling-mistakes.md): Get spelling correction for a message as it is being typed, if there is a misspelling. Only the current word
will be corrected, once it's fully typed (so it is recommended to call this endpoint after space characters).

- [Create a custom response](https://docs.asapp.com/apis/autocompose/create-a-custom-response.md): Add a single custom response for an agent
- [Create a message analytic event](https://docs.asapp.com/apis/autocompose/create-a-message-analytic-event.md): To improve the performance of ASAPP suggestions, provide information about the actions performed by the agent while composing a message by creating `message-analytic-events`.

These analytic events indicate which AutoCompose functionality was used or not. This information along with the conversation itself is used to optimize our models, resulting in better results for the agents.

We track the following types of message analytic events:
- suggestion-1-inserted: The agent selected the first of the `suggestions` from a `Suggestion` API response.
- suggestion-2-inserted: The agent selected the second of the `suggestions` from a `Suggestion` API response.
- suggestion-3-inserted: The agent selected the third of the `suggestions` from a `Suggestion` API response.
- phrase-completion-accepted: The agent selected the `phraseCompletion` from a `Suggestion` API response.
- spellcheck-applied: A correction provided in a `SpellcheckCorrection` API response was applied automatically.
- spellcheck-undone: A correction provided in a `SpellcheckCorrection` API response was undone by clicking the undo button.
- custom-response-drawer-inserted: The agent inserted one of their custom responses from the custom response drawer.
- custom-panel-inserted: The agent inserted a response from their custom response list in the custom response panel.
- global-panel-inserted: The agent inserted a response from the global response list in the global response panel.

Some of the event types have a corresponding event object to provide details.

- [Create a MessageSent analytics event](https://docs.asapp.com/apis/autocompose/create-a-messagesent-analytics-event.md): Create a MessageSent analytics event describing the agent's usage of AutoCompose augmentation features

- [Create a custom vocabulary](https://docs.asapp.com/apis/configuration/custom-vocabularies/create-custom-vocabularies.md): Creates a new custom vocabulary configuration to improve transcription accuracy.

Custom vocabularies are used to enhance speech-to-text transcription by providing:
- Specific phrases that are commonly used in your domain
- Phonetic representations ("sounds like") to help the system recognize these phrases

For example, you might define:
