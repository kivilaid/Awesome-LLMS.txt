- [Refresh API Key](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/api-keys/refresh-api-key.md): Generate a new API key and delete the current one. Provide API key to refresh as a Bearer token in the Authorization header (e.g. "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>").
- [Automatically reassign booking to a new host automatically - provided authorization header refers to person who reassigned the booking.](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/bookings/automatically-reassign-booking-to-a-new-host-automatically--provided-authorization-header-refers-to-person-who-reassigned-the-booking.md)
- [Cancel a booking](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/bookings/cancel-a-booking.md): :bookingUid can be :bookingUid of an usual booking, individual recurrence or recurring booking to cancel all recurrences.
    For seated bookings to cancel one individual booking provide :bookingUid and :seatUid in the request body. For recurring seated bookings it is not possible to cancel all of them with 1 call
    like with non-seated recurring bookings by providing recurring bookind uid - you have to cancel each recurrence booking by its bookingUid + seatUid.
- [Confirm booking that requires a confirmation - provided authorization header refers to owner of the booking.](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/bookings/confirm-booking-that-requires-a-confirmation--provided-authorization-header-refers-to-owner-of-the-booking.md)
- [Create a booking](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/bookings/create-a-booking.md): 
      POST /v2/bookings is used to create regular bookings, recurring bookings and instant bookings. The request bodies for all 3 are almost the same except:
      If eventTypeId in the request body is id of a regular event, then regular booking is created.

      If it is an id of a recurring event type, then recurring booking is created.

      Meaning that the request bodies are equal but the outcome depends on what kind of event type it is with the goal of making it as seamless for developers as possible.

      For team event types it is possible to create instant meeting. To do that just pass `"instant": true` to the request body.

      The start needs to be in UTC aka if the timezone is GMT+2 in Rome and meeting should start at 11, then UTC time should have hours 09:00 aka without time zone.

      3. uid of recurring booking which will return an array of all recurring booking recurrences (stored as recurringBookingUid on one of the individual recurrences).

- [Force refresh tokens](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-managed-users/force-refresh-tokens.md): If you have lost managed user access or refresh token, then you can get new ones by using OAuth credentials. Access token is valid for 60 minutes and refresh token for 1 year. Make sure to store them in your database, for example, in your User database model `calAccessToken` and `calRefreshToken` fields.
Response also contains `accessTokenExpiresAt` and `refreshTokenExpiresAt` fields, but if you decode the jwt token the payload will contain `clientId` (OAuth client ID), `ownerId` (user to whom token belongs ID), `iat` (issued at time) and `expiresAt` (when does the token expire) fields.

    "refresh token rotation" mechanism. Access token is valid for 60 minutes and refresh token for 1 year. Make sure to store them in your database, for example, in your User database model `calAccessToken` and `calRefreshToken` fields.

- [Create a schedule](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/schedules/create-a-schedule.md): 
      Create a schedule for the authenticated user.

      The point of creating schedules is for event types to be available at specific times.

      The first goal of schedules is to have a default schedule. If you are platform customer and created managed users, then it is important to note that each managed user should have a default schedule.
      1. If you passed `timeZone` when creating managed user, then the default schedule from Monday to Friday from 9AM to 5PM will be created with that timezone. The managed user can then change the default schedule via the `AvailabilitySettings` atom.
      2. If you did not, then we assume you want the user to have this specific schedule right away. You should create a default schedule by specifying
      `"isDefault": true` in the request body. Until the user has a default schedule the user can't be booked nor manage their schedule via the AvailabilitySettings atom.

      The second goal of schedules is to create another schedule that event types can point to. This is useful for when an event is booked because availability is not checked against the default schedule but instead against that specific schedule.
      After creating a non-default schedule, you can update an event type to point to that schedule via the PATCH `event-types/{eventTypeId}` endpoint.

      When specifying start time and end time for each day use the 24 hour format e.g. 08:00, 15:00 etc.

- [Find out when is an event type ready to be booked.](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/slots/find-out-when-is-an-event-type-ready-to-be-booked.md): 
      There are 4 ways to get available slots:
      
      1. By event type id. Event type id can be of user and team event types. Example '/v2/slots?eventTypeId=10&start=2050-09-05&end=2050-09-06&timeZone=Europe/Rome'

      2. By event type slug + username. Example '/v2/slots?eventTypeSlug=intro&username=bob&start=2050-09-05&end=2050-09-06'

      3. By event type slug + username + organization slug when searching within an organization. Example '/v2/slots?organizationSlug=org-slug&eventTypeSlug=intro&username=bob&start=2050-09-05&end=2050-09-06'

      4. By usernames only (used for dynamic event type - there is no specific event but you want to know when 2 or more people are available). Example '/v2/slots?usernames=alice,bob&username=bob&organizationSlug=org-slug&start=2050-09-05&end=2050-09-06'. As you see you also need to provide the slug of the organization to which each user in the 'usernames' array belongs.

      All of them require "start" and "end" query parameters which define the time range for which available slots should be checked.
      Optional parameters are:
      - timeZone: Time zone in which the available slots should be returned. Defaults to UTC.
      - duration: Only use for event types that allow multiple durations or for dynamic event types. If not passed for multiple duration event types defaults to default duration. For dynamic event types defaults to 30 aka each returned slot is 30 minutes long. So duration=60 means that returned slots will be each 60 minutes long.
      - slotFormat: Format of the slots. By default return is an object where each key is date and value is array of slots as string. If you want to get start and end of each slot use "range" as value.
      
- [Get reserved slot](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/slots/get-reserved-slot.md)
- [Reserve a slot](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/slots/reserve-a-slot.md): Make a slot not available for others to book for a certain period of time. If you authenticate using oAuth credentials, api key or access token
    then you can also specify custom duration for how long the slot should be reserved for (defaults to 5 minutes).
