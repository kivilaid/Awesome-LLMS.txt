## Find. Fix. Save. Repeat.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Find-1.png)

### Find

CloudFix continuously scans your AWS environment for savings opportunities and performance enhancements. It focuses on smaller âfixesâ that have a big impact at scale, and flags only the optimizations that AWS has already identified as risk free.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Fix-1.png)

### Fix

Unlike tools that only find savings, CloudFix actually runs the optimizations â easily and automatically. Every fix is no-risk, AWS-recommended, and guaranteed not to cause downtime. Plus, CloudFixâs least privilege model makes sure youâre always secure.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Save-1.png)

[Why CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/why-cloudfix/)

# Find. Fix. Save. Repeat.

**CloudFix makes it easy to implement the latest AWS best practices for nonstop cost savings and a cloud thatâs always running at its peak.**

[Get a free savings assessment](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/)

### Stop spending money you don't have to. CloudFix is a safe and automated way to save.

Every week, AWS releases 50+ advisories for ways to optimize your cloud, from improving performance to reducing costs. The CloudFix experts find the recommendations that are 100% risk free and turn them into âfixersâ â straightforward optimizations that can be run automatically with zero service interruption.

## How CloudFix works

![Screenshot: Onboard](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-onboard-min.png)

##### Set up

## [Connect to CloudFix through your AWS account](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-bb65f-connect-to-cloudfix-through-your-aws-account)

CloudFix uses read-only IAM roles to securely connect to your AWS accounts without any long-term credentials, passwords, access keys, or permissions.

## [Configure CloudFix quickly and securely](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-bb65f-configure-cloudfix-quickly-and-securely)

An AWS CloudFormation template is used to configure your account with the appropriate IAM roles and permissions so CloudFix can both identify and orchestrate fixes. CloudFix leverages AWS tools in your environment to implement the AWS best practice of a âleast privilegeâ model with no elevated permissions.

## [View all your accounts in a single dashboard](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-bb65f-view-all-your-accounts-in-a-single-dashboard)

CloudFix allows you to connect multiple AWS accounts, so you can see all your recommendations in one convenient place.

##### Find

## [Scan your accounts for savings opportunities](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-48efa-scan-your-accounts-for-savings-opportunities)

Once your AWS accounts are configured, CloudFix uses âfinders,â a read-only process that analyzes your account for savings and performance improvements.

## [Trust that your data is safe](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-48efa-trust-that-your-data-is-safe)

CloudFix finders use a combination of AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and secure API calls to AWS CloudWatch metrics to run their analysis. They never access any customer or company data in any data store.

## [Enjoy always-on, nonstop scanning](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-48efa-enjoy-always-on-nonstop-scanning)

CloudFix continuously scans your accounts for any changes in your AWS environments or any new AWS advisories, so youâre always up-to-date and fully optimized.

![Screenshot: recommendations](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-recommendations-min.png)

![Screenshot: recommendation example](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-recommendation-example-min.png)

##### Fix

## [Review your recommended fixes](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-583bd-review-your-recommended-fixes)

Evaluate your fixes in Change Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, then run them with just a few clicks. Using Change Manager lets CloudFix leverage your runbooks to help automate changes.

## [Retain complete control over what, when, and how fixes are applied](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-583bd-retain-complete-control-over-what-when-and-how-fixes-are-applied)

With CloudFix, you can decide whether to deploy fixes automatically or approve them individually in Change Manager. You have complete control over who can approve fixer templates in Change Manager. And as part of the approval process, you can choose to execute the fixer instantly, or to schedule it for a specific day and time.

## [Run fixes to optimize cost and performance](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-583bd-run-fixes-to-optimize-cost-and-performance)

CloudFix makes it fast and easy to reduce costs, improve performance, and ensure complete compliance with AWS best practices. Most CloudFix customers spend just minutes every week reviewing and running their fixes.

### A fixer library thatâs always growing

CloudFix creates new fixers regularly when AWS publishes new advisories. Instead of having to track the latest recommendations, then manually implement them, CloudFix automatically keeps your cloud up to date and cost optimized.

##### Example fixers include:

## [Duplicate AWS CloudTrail](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-c9b5e-duplicate-aws-cloudtrail)

Disables duplicate AWS CloudTrail trails that deliver the same copy of management events, removing the entire cost of AWS CloudTrail.

## [Amazon CloudFront Compression](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-c9b5e-amazon-cloudfront-compression)

Analyze and enable compression when no caching / compression policy or policy allows compression to reduce data egress costs.

## [Amazon EBS IO1/IO2 to GP3](https://cloudfix.com/product/\#tag-in-c9b5e-amazon-ebs-io1-io2-to-gp3)

Monitors Amazon EBS volume usage and analyzes metrics to identify Amazon EBS IO1/IO2 volumes that are apt for migration to the GP3 volume type.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-recommendations-overlay-min.png)

## Savings that are always 100% safe

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Risk-Free-Icon.svg)

##### 100% risk free

Every CloudFix fixer has been rigorously tested to minimize the risk of disruption, so you never have to worry about breaking your environment.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Zero-downtime-icon.svg)

##### Zero service interruption

CloudFix specifically identifies and only runs the optimization opportunities that require no service interruptions.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Least-priviledge-icon.svg)

##### Least privilege permissions

All CloudFix fixes happen through Change Manager, keeping your accounts and data completely secure.

## Quick to deploy. Easy to run. Simple to save.

##### Lightweight and affordable

CloudFix can be deployed in hours, not weeks. As a cloud-native solution, it has a small footprint that wonât contribute to tool sprawl.

##### Intuitive UI

The CloudFix dashboard features a user-friendly interface that makes it fast and easy to understand your recommendations and take action on them.

##### Always-on scanning

CloudFix scans nonstop in the background, constantly assessing your environment for new savings opportunities.

![ISV Accelerate Partner](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/aws_partner_logo.svg)

#### 100% committed to AWS

CloudFix is proud to be an official AWS partner, Qualified Software vendor, and a part of the ISV Accelerate, GTM Accelerate programs.

## Our AWS Story

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/puzzle-icon.svg)

##### 15+ years of AWS collaboration

CloudFix Founder and Chief Evangelist Rahul Subramaniam began working with AWS in 2007, shortly after it launched. Rahul recognized that AWS had changed the game, providing products that shifted the onus on technology teams from writing code to consuming services. The cost of that consumption, however, can add up â which is why Rahul built CloudFix.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cycle-icon.svg)

##### Technology that evolves with AWS

CloudFix operates in lockstep with AWS, collaborating with product managers to understand what new services are launching and how current products are changing. This advanced technology sharing ensures that as AWS evolves, CloudFix does too. Just as AWS constantly releases new offerings, CloudFix continuously updates its fixer library to help customers achieve always-increasing value.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/archictecture-icon.svg)

##### Top-to-bottom AWS architecture

From Change Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to AWS Config to Amazon CloudWatch, CloudFix builds on AWS core services to simplify cost management with maximum ease and security. Because we stitch together frameworks that AWS recommends, everything that CloudFix does already works together seamlessly.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Cost-icon.svg)

##### Cost optimization for every AWS customer

CloudFix connects to most of the top AWS services, including AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) , and Change Manager. Whether you are just beginning to leverage AWS or use numerous products with a spend in the millions, CloudFix can reduce costs, improve performance, and empower your team to keep up with every AWS innovation.

## How CloudFix integrates with AWS

CloudFix worked closely with AWS to implement their best practice of a least privilege model by leveraging all the native AWS tooling in the customerâs environment. CloudFix only uses a minimal set of data in its dashboard to track the compounding savings realized with the tool.

Depending on where you reside, you may have the right to exercise additional rights available to you under applicable laws, including:

- Right of erasure. You may have a broader right to erasure of personal data that we hold about you.

Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations, among other things.
- Right to object to processing. You may have the right to request that we stop processing your personal data, including the right to opt in or opt out of the sale of your Personal Data to third parties, or to stop sending you marketing communications.

### Getting your free savings assessment is quick and easy.

Hereâs how it works:

- CloudFix uses a 100% secure, AWS-recommended way to create cross-account access via read-only IAM roles deployed through a CloudFormation Stack.
- This allows CloudFix to create and query a Cost & Usage Report as well as read resource configurations and make recommendations for cost optimizations.
- Once the setup is complete, CloudFix will execute a read-only scan and generate savings recommendations in just 24 hours. This is where you find out how much you can save!

[Start your free savings assessment](https://app.cloudfix.com/register/)

###### OR

[Contact Us](https://cloudfix.com/contact-us/)

##### Double check permissions and protocols

Ensure that you have Admin and Billing access to your AWS Management account, that AWS CloudFormation StackSets are activated within your AWS Organization, and that required Service Quotas are in place.

## How CloudFix works

![Screenshot: Onboard](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-onboard-min.png)

##### 1\. Set up

## [Connect to CloudFix through your AWS account](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-13092-connect-to-cloudfix-through-your-aws-account)

CloudFix uses read-only IAM roles to securely connect to your AWS accounts without any long-term credentials, passwords, access keys, or permissions.

## [Configure CloudFix quickly and securely](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-13092-configure-cloudfix-quickly-and-securely)

An AWS CloudFormation template is used to configure your account with the appropriate IAM roles and permissions so CloudFix can both identify and orchestrate fixes. CloudFix leverages AWS tools in your environment to implement the AWS best practice of a âleast privilegeâ model with no elevated permissions.

## [View all your accounts in a single dashboard](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-13092-view-all-your-accounts-in-a-single-dashboard)

CloudFix allows you to connect multiple AWS accounts, so you can see all your recommendations in one convenient place.

##### 2\. Find

## [Scan your accounts for savings opportunities](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-bf6c9-scan-your-accounts-for-savings-opportunities)

Once your AWS accounts are configured, CloudFix uses âfinders,â a read-only process that analyzes your account for savings and performance improvements.

## [Trust that your data is safe](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-bf6c9-trust-that-your-data-is-safe)

CloudFix finders use a combination of AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and secure API calls to AWS CloudWatch Metrics to run their analysis. They never access any customer or company data in any data store.

## [Enjoy always-on, nonstop scanning](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-bf6c9-enjoy-always-on-nonstop-scanning)

CloudFix continuously scans your accounts for any changes in your AWS environments or any new AWS advisories, so youâre always up-to-date and fully optimized.

![Screenshot: recommendations](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-recommendations-min.png)

![Screenshot: recommendation example](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-recommendation-example-min.png)

##### 3\. Fix

## [Review your recommended fixes](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-a263d-review-your-recommended-fixes)

Evaluate your fixes in AWS Change Manager, then run them with just a few clicks. Using AWS Change Manager lets CloudFix leverage your runbooks to help automate changes.

## [Retain complete control over what, when, and how fixes are applied](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-a263d-retain-complete-control-over-what-when-and-how-fixes-are-applied)

With CloudFix, you can decide whether to deploy fixes automatically or approve them individually in AWS Change Manager. You have complete control over who can approve fixer templates in AWS Change Manager. And as part of the approval process, you can choose to execute the fixer instantly, or to schedule it for a specific day and time.

## [Run fixes to optimize cost and performance](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-a263d-run-fixes-to-optimize-cost-and-performance)

CloudFix makes it fast and easy to reduce costs, improve performance, and ensure complete compliance with AWS best practices. Most CloudFix customers spend just minutes every week reviewing and running their fixes.

[Start your free savings assessment](https://app.cloudfix.com/register/)

### A fixer library thatâs always growing

CloudFix creates new fixers regularly when AWS publishes new advisories. Instead of having to track the latest recommendations, then manually implement them, CloudFix automatically keeps your cloud up to date and cost optimized.

##### Example fixers include:

## [Duplicate CloudTrails](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-a765e-duplicate-cloudtrails)

Disables duplicate CloudTrail trails that deliver the same copy of management events, removing the entire cost of CloudTrail.

## [CloudFront Compression](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-a765e-cloudfront-compression)

Analyze and enable compression when no caching / compression policy or policy allows compression to reduce data egress costs.

## [EBS IO1/IO2 to GP3](https://cloudfix.com/assessment/\#tag-in-a765e-ebs-io1-io2-to-gp3)

Monitors EBS volume usage and analyzes metrics to identify EBS IO1/IO2 volumes that are apt for migration to the GP3 volume type.

# QueryLens

QueryLens helps you avoid expensive RDS extended support charges by safely upgrading your MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. Our AI-powered analysis helps you understand and address compatibility issues before they become problems.

## The Problem

- AWS charges significant fees for extended RDS support after version end-of-life
- Organizations delay upgrades due to fear of breaking critical SQL queries
- Manual query review is time-consuming and error-prone
- Privacy concerns make it hard to get expert help with upgrades

## How QueryLens Helps

- **Automated Query Analysis**
  - Captures existing RDS query patterns
  - Obfuscates sensitive data automatically
  - Evaluates compatibility with target versions
  - Identifies breaking changes before they impact production
- **Smart Privacy Protection**
  - All query analysis happens in your AWS account
  - Built-in data obfuscation removes sensitive values
  - No query data leaves your environment
  - Secure by design
- **Clear Migration Path**
  - Shows exact compatibility percentage
  - Lists specific queries needing updates
  - Explains why changes are needed
  - Provides suggested query modifications

## Supported Upgrades

- MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0
- PostgreSQL upgrades to current versions
- Aurora version transitions
- Additional database engines coming soon

### Example Findings

```
Total Queries Analyzed: 603
Compatible: 98.84%
Needs Updates: 1.16%
```

QueryLens identifies specific issues like:

- Deprecated system variables (e.g., tx\_isolation â transaction\_isolation)
- Performance schema compatibility changes
- Syntax updates between versions

## Getting Started

1. Deploy our CloudFormation stack in your AWS account
2. Select databases for analysis
3. Get detailed compatibility reports
4. Plan your upgrade with confidence

## Immediate savings with just a few clicks

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Fixers-icon.svg)

##### It actually fixes, not just finds.

Donât settle for a visualization tool that just shows you savings opportunities. With 50+ AWS advisories every week, youâll never be able to keep up. Thatâs why CloudFix does all the work for you. You just approve the savings you want, and CloudFix achieves it instantly â saving you 15% â 60% per AWS service.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-circle-check.svg)

##### Itâs simple, safe, and comprehensive.

Donât put your cloud at risk. Every âfixerâ from CloudFix follows AWS advisories and is extensively tested. CloudFix also works across most of the top AWS services and is adding new ones regularly, so you can save and optimize everywhere, not just on storage or compute.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-time.svg)

##### It works nonstop.

CloudFix never stops finding new savings opportunities. It scans all the new services you add and resources you provision, and regularly helps you bank new savings with just a few easy clicks.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-graph.svg)

##### Itâs compounding savings for your cloud.

Since AWS never stops publishing savings advisories â and CloudFix never stops automating them â your savings build like compounding interest. Itâs the exact opposite of expensive consulting engagements or underwhelming visualization tools, where you pay big and only save once.

## The no-brainer addition to your cost savings toolkit

CloudFix complements your existing AWS cost optimization tools, like AWS Cost Explorer or AWS Trusted Advisor, by automatically fixing the no-risk âquick winâ opportunities that AWS recommends. Itâs easy to deploy, easy to run, and always affordable, with immediate ROI. Savings thousands of dollars (or millions) in just minutes every week â thatâs a no-brainer.

### Built on AWS, for AWS

Aurea, the parent company of CloudFix, began using AWS in 2007, shortly after its launch. As our footprint grew, Founder Rahul Subramaniam knew that we needed a way to control costs while doubling down on the latest AWS services. Rahul and his team built a solution that finds and fixes the cost optimization opportunities that most companies donât have time to address. That solution became CloudFix â the easiest way to reduce AWS costs while taking full advantage of its breadth of game-changing offerings. With CloudFix, Aurea transformed from early AWS innovation partner to a technology powerhouse that now proudly deploys every single AWS service.

## CloudFix Milestones

Convinced that it is the operating system of the future, Aurea moves away from other clouds and commits 100% to AWS.

- 2010-2018



#### Our AWS footprint grows exponentially



Aurea quickly scales to managing over 45,000 AWS instances across 200+ companies, but struggles to control the costs associated with that growth.

- 2018



#### CloudFix is born



CloudFix Founder and Chief Evangelist Rahul Subramaniam leads his team in developing an in-house tool that finds savings opportunities and implements them automatically.

- 2021



#### CloudFix officially launches at AWS re:Invent



Inspired by Amazonâs commercialization of their own services as AWS, Aurea launches CloudFix as a publicly available service.

- 2022



#### CloudFix finds millions in savings across 1000s of accounts



CloudFix now helps dozens of companies optimize thousands of AWS accounts, realizing millions of dollars in savings for AWS customers.

- 2023 and beyond



#### CloudFix expands with more fixers across more AWS services



The CloudFix team continues to bring the latest AWS recommendations into the product, constantly growing the fixer library to find more savings from your entire AWS footprint.

# Identify hidden costs caused by CloudTrailâs management event recording

![Identify hidden costs caused by CloudTrailâs management event recording](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Generic-5-1-2.png)

## Finding savings: Understanding your CloudTrail cost and purpose

Having a thorough understanding of your AWS from an administrative perspective is crucial to optimizing your costs and performance. AWS CloudTrail helps you do that by providing governance on actions taken in your AWS accounts. However, it also creates duplicate reports that cost money, creating unnecessary spend on your bill.

AWS creates the duplicate record so that you can have a report accessible from two different S3 buckets. However, the duplicated event adds a cost, whereas the first record is free. Paying for a duplicate record as a default setting does not make sense, and making this change can save you money.

## Realizing savings: How to deduplicate unnecessary expenses

AWS allows you to change this setting manually in your instance so that you are not wasting spend on unnecessary resources. The process is straightforward and can be performed easily for each trail. [Read here](https://awsmadeeasy.com/blog/cloudtrail-costs/) to learn more and understand fully how these costs are created, and how to take manual steps to amend them.

## Optimizing savings: Optimize your AWS instances more efficiently with CloudFix

Modern businesses need efficient solutions to these kinds of problems. Manually changing every instance of a trail with a duplicated record is not a sustainable solution for either your current implementation or for your future ones. Thankfully, CloudFix optimizes your AWS accounts for you and regularly monitors your usage and costs across your organization to search for this and other opportunities for savings. CloudFix offers real solutions for your business. Read more about how CloudFix uniquely manages your risk-free savings opportunities [here](https://cloudfix.com/resources/).

# InsideSales cuts database operational costs by 62% with CloudFix

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/insidesales-header.png)

> With CloudFix, InsideSales cut database costs by 62%, EBS costs by 23%, and S3 costs by 22%

## How a growing software company slashed its AWS costs with automation and expertise

_InsideSales, based in Austin, TX, creates software designed for enterprise sales and account management. With Playbooksâ¢ from InsideSales, sales professionals increase productivity, optimize customer interactions, and connect to the right buyers. Playbooks manages lead follow-up and prospecting cadences, automates administrative tasks, and uses data to predict who, when, and how to engage buyers for the best outcome._

## An influx of new features and customers results in too many databases

InsideSales faced a good problem, but a problem nonetheless. Due to rapid growth of its customer base, along with a steady development of new features, the company found itself with an unmanageable number of databases. Initially, there were 874 databases running on a total of 175 Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances. InsideSales knew it needed to reduce maintenance and operational costs without redesigning the entire application suite.

InsideSales discovered CloudFix through its professional network. The organization looked to CloudFix for both its automated cost optimization capabilities as well as the companyâs expertise in AWS cost savings.

## CloudFix streamlines and automates the migration to Amazon Aurora

To address InsideSalesâ database issue, the CloudFix team recommended migrating to Amazon Aurora. A cloud-native managed database, Amazon Aurora provides managed load balancers, multi-AZ writes, backups, failover, failure detection and recovery. The larger the Amazon Aurora instance size, the more performance you get; not just CPU and memory, but also network IO and disk IOPS. These features enabled InsideSales to combine great workloads and run multi-tenant database instances as a cost-reduction solution.

> With CloudFix, InsideSales was able to streamline and automate the migration and consolidation process wherever possible to achieve zero outages.

With CloudFix, InsideSales was able to streamline and automate the migration and consolidation process wherever possible to achieve zero outages. After gathering all the required data and identifying all database references, the team performed thorough checks to make sure there were no applications that monopolizing shared resources and affecting overall performance, availability and stability.

The CloudFix team didnât stop there. They performed extensive checks before, during, and after the migration with AWS Database Migration Service to ensure data integrity and prevent any problems during the cutover from the old to the new database cluster.

## InsideSales cuts database costs by 62%, plus reduces spend on EBS and S3

In collaboration with CloudFix, InsideSales consolidated all 874 databases into a single Amazon Aurora cluster, greatly reducing its maintenance burden. But maintenance effort wasnât the only thing that went down: InsideSales reduced its annual database operational costs from $641,000 to $244,000, a 61.93% cost savings.

> InsideSales reduced its annual database operational costs from $641,000 to $244,000, a 61.93% cost savings.

CloudFixâs standard automated fixers helped InsideSales save on AWS, too. The company cut its Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) costs by 23.40% by retyping gp2 volumes to gp3 and 22.19% by enabling Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Intelligent-Tiering on all suitable buckets.

Whatâs next for InsideSales? The team plans to continue working with CloudFix to further fine-tune the performance of the Amazon Aurora cluster and pursue additional avenues for savings, such as Reserved Instances. They also continue to roll out new CloudFix fixers as theyâre released, with full confidence that CloudFix will keep finding new opportunities for InsideSales to pay less for AWS.

Success Story

# Mobilogy saves 25% on AWS storage costs with CloudFix

![mobilogy Success Story](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/mobilogy-header.png)

## How a growing software company optimized Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes to slash its AWS spend

_Mobilogy offers advanced mobile lifecycle solutions that enable operators, retailers, buyback vendors, and enterprises to provide enhanced customer experience, increase revenue, improve productivity, enhance security, and reduce cost. Through in-store, online, and on-device delivery channels, Mobilogy customers enjoy services ranging from advanced diagnostics to content transfer, backup, restore, wipe, and automated phone buyback._

Mobilogy deploys over 75,000 units at more than 100 mobile operators and retailers globally, representing well over 50,000 outlets handling hundreds of millions of transactions per year. The company turned to AWS to support this level of scale â but soon found that costs were higher than expected.

## Mobilogy discovers automated AWS savings with CloudFix

As Mobilogyâs customer base grew, so did their AWS spend. Although the cost of compute and networking resources was elastic based on traffic, their storage cost was growing steadily. Mobilogy needed a way to reduce storage costs without sacrificing performance and service availability.

Enter CloudFix.

The Mobilogy team discovered that several of CloudFixâs âfixersâ could help them optimize and lower their storage costs. With CloudFix, Mobilogy was able to:

- Move rarely accessed data stored in the S3 Standard Tier to the Infrequent Access Tier by [enabling Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering](https://cloudfix.com/blog/aws-s3-intelligent-tiering-default-storage-class/)
- [Convert gp2 volumes to gp3 volumes](https://cloudfix.com/blog/migrate-gp2-to-gp3-better-performance-lower-costs/), which are less expensive and offer higher maximum throughput rates while maintaining the same high levels of durability and availability
- [Migrate io1 and io2 volumes to gp3](https://cloudfix.com/blog/optimize-aws-elastic-block-storage-by-migrating-io1-and-io2-volumes-to-gp3/) to cut costs by approximately half without sacrificing performance

## How Mobilogy saved 25% on AWS storage costs with CloudFix

Mobilogy was thrilled that so many fixers could be applied directly to its environment. The IT team reviewed CloudFixâs recommended changes, evaluated the total cost and potential savings of each resource and fix, then implemented them with just a few clicks. Mobilogy also took advantage of the automation of CloudFix, ensuring that the fixes not only ran once, but continued to find and execute nonstop savings.

The result: Mobilogy reduced their storage costs by 25% by optimizing the costs of Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon EBS volumes. They experienced zero service disruptions or performance issues during or after the fixes were applied. And best of all, with CloudFix, Mobilogy can rely on new savings every year as new fixers are released. For this growing company, thatâs a game-changer.

# Lower your AWS costs by optimizing EFS tiering

![Lower your AWS costs by optimizing EFS tiering](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Cost-spikes.png)

## Finding savings: What is EFS tiering?

AWS Elastic File System is a network file system for Linux machines on AWS (EC2 or VMC) that allows you to build a serverless and scalable file system with ease. EFS has two primary storage tiers: Standard and OneZone, each of which has a secondary tier called [Infrequent Access (IA)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/features/infrequent-access/).

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/pricing-table-2.png)AWS EFS Tiering for US East as of April 2022

The main trade-off involved with moving files to this tier is that files in this tier have 10x higher latency, meaning that files in IA should never require quick access by clients or applications.

## Realizing savings: How EFS Intelligent-Tiering lowers your costs

EFS comes with âIntelligent Tieringâ which allows you to create a lifecycle policy that automatically migrates your less-frequently accessed files to the less-expensive Infrequent Access tier, saving you up to 92% on your EFS bills.

Migrating to IA, however, means that your files will have much lower latency. To ensure that you have the right balance between quick access and cost savings, we created a capacity model that maximizes savings while minimizing any financial or downtime risk. You can read [more detailed information here](https://awsmadeeasy.com/blog/aws-efs-tiering/), including instructions on how to implement this same capacity model and lifecycle policies with your own EFS.

## Optimizing savings: Optimize EFS with CloudFix

Realistically, modern businesses need cost optimization across their entire AWS environment. Thatâs why we created CloudFix. CloudFix optimizes your AWS safely by regularly monitoring usage and cost, searching for opportunities to realize risk-free savings. Not only does CloudFix monitor for these opportunities, but it will also fix them for you. This means that you can now be efficient as well as effective.

CloudFix not only monitors EFS, but it also monitors for numerous other optimizations. Pulling from AWSâs own advisory blog for risk-free solutions, CloudFix filters through potential savings opportunities to find and present the right ones for your business. Introducing CloudFix to your business will optimize your AWS space to be more efficient, have better performance, and save you money.

### Transcript

**Hilary Doyle:** Is AWS eating up the software landscape?

**Matt Asay:** I mean, itâs an obvious, no.

**Hilary Doyle:** I donât know. Sounds fishy to me.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I would not put it past them to create another two-pizza team.

**Matt Asay:** Rabble-rouser.

**Hilary Doyle:** This is AWS Insiders, an original podcast by CloudFix about the services, patterns, and future of cloud computing at AWS. CloudFix is a tool that finds and implements 100% safe, AWS recommended, cost savings. Thatâs fixes, not just analytics. Iâm Hilary Doyle. Joined, as always, joined by Rahul Subramaniam. Rahul, you ready to do this?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Hey, Hilary. Do you ever need to ask? I have my coffee and Iâm all set to go.

**Hilary Doyle:** All right. In this episode, conflict, controversy, subterfuge, secrecy. Most people we approached did not even want to speak on the record. This is some Deep Throat stuff.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** That almost sounds like a trailer for a movie, Hilary.

**Hilary Doyle:** What we want to know is â is AWS eating up the software landscape? And if it is, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Rahul, serve it up for us. Take us into the software ecosystem on AWS.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** AWS came into this world with a mission to basically become the plumbing for the internet. Now, what that meant was that they were going to create all of the simple building blocks that would allow anyone to get their applications

built and deployed on the internet.

**Hilary Doyle:** Sounds reasonable.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** And boy, did they take that mission to heart. I mean, today they have nearly 100,000 APIs that allow you to do all sorts of amazing things. Many of them were just unthinkable a few years ago.

**Hilary Doyle:** Thatâs very cool. And to be clear, these arenât all created or managed by AWS. So how are the majority of non-AWS APIs structured?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Many of them are really open-source, and this is where things get interesting. While AWS was becoming the plumbing of the internet, the open-source movement was also picking up at the same time. And companies figured that if they open-sourced their software and monetized the managed services for the enterprises, it was a win-win. What they didnât count on was AWS diligently commoditizing these products and offering their own versions as managed services too.

**Hilary Doyle:** Oh, the subterfuge. Thatâs a teaser. Thereâs lots to come. We have a very special guest, Matt Asay from MongoDB. He is an open-source expert. Heâs also worked with developers at AWS and Adobe. There will be our hot takes, per usual. I say our, you know theyâre yours. As well as tips and tricks, and weâre going to call in a use case. But first, letâs get to your AWS news headlines.

Rahul, AWS has announced Nitro Enclaves. Nitro Enclaves help customers reduce the attack surface area for sensitive data processing applications. Itâs now available on Graviton 2 and Graviton 3 Amazon EC2 instances. Thoughts? Feelings? Will you ever use this?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Hilary, this one is for the paranoid.

**Hilary Doyle:** Perfect.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Iâve heard so many people talk about the public cloud being less secure because the infrastructure is shared between customers. Well, in AWS, you can create enclaves that are at the hardware level for your compute. They have had Intel and AMD instances there for a while, and they just added Graviton to the list of supported processes, so you can now leverage Gravitonâs price performance benefit with all the advantages of hardware level isolation. I mean, I really hope this finally puts one of the most fundamental arguments against the Cloud to rest.

**Hilary Doyle:** It is dead to me. Formula One, the International Race Car Organization, has re-upped and expanded its partnership with AWS to help increase car performance with things like AI and machine learning in the cloud. There is no latency allowed for Formula One. What do you think of this? No latency allowed.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Let me start by giving you a tip, Hilary.

**Hilary Doyle:** A driving tip?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** No. I mean, you have to watch this video, by the way. Itâs one of the most fascinating ones Iâve watched on YouTube. This is about the pit stop timing that has changed in Formula One from the late 50s to now. I mean, they went from minutes down to 1.8 seconds. I mean, itâs absolutely fascinating.

**Hilary Doyle:** Even minutes, itâs impressive.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** But coming back to the story, F1 came to AWS a few years ago to help crunch an insane amount of data. Did you know that each car has over 300 sensors generating millions of data points every second as it drives about, what, 230 miles an hour?

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah. Theyâve been data enabled since the end of the 70s, and it has only gotten better. So this is amazing. I really enjoy F1. Keep going.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So during races, this data gets sent to the pit, helping the team make split second decisions. The next level up in this partnership will really be race simulations that are off the track. I canât wait to see whatâs going to happen to these cars in the next 10 years.

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah, that is really exciting. Amazon Prime is rolling out a new 12 hour sports talk day, so now you will not be surprised if 11 of those hours are Formula One. Those are your AWS headlines.

Rahul, back to the topic at hand, is AWS eating up the software landscape? For years, AWS has been accused of taking other companiesâ open-source software and releasing their own very similar looking products â sometimes even copying parts of the names of those products. The term people use is strip mining software. And itâs been so bad that every year at re:Invent, when AWS execs give keynotes announcing new products, startups and small companies basically prepare to get annihilated. The event is commonly known as The Red Wedding, and if youâve seen the carnage in Game of Thrones, then you are catching that vibe.

Obviously, it is no surprise AWS has been taken to court. Elastic sued them for copyright infringement of Elasticsearch, but in the majority of cases, companies sound like theyâve been scared into silence. This, after all, is AWS who, for a time, banned the use of the phrase multi-cloud â because as far as theyâre concerned, there is only ever AWS. So most of the companies on the platform donât want to alienate the platform. Itâs still their bread and butter. Theyâre just kind of handing over their lunch money. Rahul, how did we get here? How does AWS get away with creating products that look exactly the same as other products?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** To begin with, itâs important to understand that âother companiesâ open-source softwareâ, as you said, isnât really a thing. If it is open-source, it belongs to everyone.

**Hilary Doyle:** But should it? All right, go on.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Letâs just go back to a decade or so ago, when open-source was becoming mainstream and it was becoming work. Contributing to open-source software was being seen as something positive for brands. I mean, it is why Microsoft â once one of the most anti open-source companies that existed â embraced open-source, and built back their image after their brand took a beating due to all of those antitrust cases. I mean, the challenge was that companies were trying to figure out how to make money while literally giving away their core software for free.

**Hilary Doyle:** Sounds like a bad business strategy to me.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I would think so. And this is when the new model of offering managed services became a staple.

**Hilary Doyle:** Enter AWS, which, we should mention, is no stranger to sustainable business models â since it was literally AWS that pulled an unprofitable Amazon into the black. But I digress.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Yeah. And over time, AWS saw an opportunity to commoditize these managed services themselves and offer them as part of their service catalog. I mean, often these services were way more reliable, way more scalable, yet cheaper. And while this is great for customers, I guess those software makers just felt a little betrayed and squeezed.

**Hilary Doyle:** Betrayed and squeezed. A common foundation in many relationships, but never your top pick.

In every use case, we talk about a company that has leveraged the AWS platform to optimize their business, but in this episode, we are doing something a little different. Weâre looking at a company thatâs leveraged one of the open-source providers on AWS. I mean, total change of pace. Hold onto your hats. Can you hear me now, Rahul?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Yes, I can hear you just fine, Hilary. We arenât on a Zoom call.

**Hilary Doyle:** If you were around in the 2000s â Can you hear me now â is etched in your mind right next to a flip phone. Verizon Wireless promised fewer dropped calls than its competitors, which now sounds almost quaint. Do you remember when phones just phoned?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Totally.

**Hilary Doyle:** Anyway, in 2019, Verizon and other phone companies started rolling out the 5G mobile network. Good for us, but definitely a challenge for telecoms. Rahul, would you set this up for us? We can hear you now.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Hilary, 5G is way faster than previous mobile networks, and you can do so much more cool stuff with it, like build traffic networks where cars can talk to each other, or interesting things like AR and VR. But to leverage all that 5G has to offer, Verizon really needed to radically improve its infrastructure with much greater scalability and compute power, and it really needed a strong data processing pipeline to help follow its customers wherever they are.

So Verizon turned to MongoDB, an open-source, NoSQL database on AWS. Now, when we come back to this later, you will see how a third party product can combine with an AWS service to bring about an edge computing solution. That is so awesome. But first, I am really excited to talk to Matt Asay.

**Hilary Doyle:** Me too. That is right. Speaking of MongoDB, Matt Asay is their Vice President of Partner Marketing. Heâs a veteran tech columnist, an open-source expert, and heâs worked in developer marketing at both AWS and Adobe. So letâs get to it. Hey, Matt, welcome to the show.

**Matt Asay:** Thank you for having me. Grateful to be here.

**Hilary Doyle:** This was our question at the top of the show and weâll pose it to you, is AWS eating up the software landscape?

**Matt Asay:** I mean, itâs an obvious no.

**Hilary Doyle:** Why is it obvious for you? Because I donât think thatâs the case for a lot of developers out there.

**Matt Asay:** I think some of the criticism over the years for AWS has come from those who maybe donât understand how the company operates, how the individual teams operate, as autonomous product teams. If you talk with someone internally, they are very earnestly trying to solve help leadership principle number one for AWS, which is customer obsession. But there are different ways to reach that leadership principle, and I do think at timesâ¦ So Iâm an English major by background and Iâm probably now going to make a reference that 99% of your listeners wonât understand.

**Hilary Doyle:** Try us.

**Matt Asay:** Lennie, Of Mice and Men, ends up killing Curleyâs wife. He doesnât mean to; heâs just stronger than he understands. I never saw a single instance of deliberate ill will or strip mining, I never saw that when I worked at AWS. But I did sometimes see a blindness, not an intentional blindness, but a blindness to partner needs or to the larger ecosystem.

**Hilary Doyle:** Itâs really helpful context, because I think there are rules of competition and then thereâs the, youâre not even playing in the same league. Should the biggest big tech players be forced to play by a different set of rules, especially when it comes to open-source?

**Matt Asay:** My immediate inclination is to say maybe, but then if I back up just a little bit, ultimately what I think every enterprise has to think through is, how do I keep open-source sustainable? I think AWS, I think my company, MongoDB, I think a range of companies, weâre all trying to figure out, how do we make this work for us?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Matt, I think Iâd call out one exception to that rule.

**Hilary Doyle:** Let me guess.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Which is-

**Matt Asay:** Rabble rouser.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Thatâs got to be Oracle. I mean, what they did with JDK.

**Matt Asay:** Hey, if you want to beat up on Oracle, Iâm here for that. Just keep going.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** No, I mean what they did with MySQL and JDK and a bunch of other stuff was just, I mean, ridiculous. But, that said, the fact that some company, or set of individuals, for that matter, when they decide to put out something as open-source, theyâre counting on a community to contribute to it, to grow it. Because more often than not, they donât have the resources to develop it to a point where it becomes mainstream.

And when I talk to most founders of open-source projects, or maintained as an open-source project, they never imagined in their wildest dream that what they put out there would become that popular or theyâd get that many downloads. So to claim ownership of that original code that you put out is not really a fair argument, because the community has contributed so much to it over a period of time to make it mainstream as well.

**Matt Asay:** 100%. Yeah.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So Iâm just curious about your thoughts on this. When we look at a lot of these enterprises that have open-sourced their stuff, how have you seen them think about open-source?

**Matt Asay:** One thing that really shocked me when I rejoined MongoDB, because this is my second time working for the company. 2013, 2014, open-source and the community aspect was, I would say, the secret sauce. It was the thing. That and the ease of use for the product.

Coming back post SSPL, Server Side Public License, I donât know, I expected something bad to have happened. But the interesting thing is, developers didnât seem to care, and it shocked me. Or I should say, customers didnât seem to care. They wanted a database that was easy to use, that they could get easy access to. And so Iâve started to think that maybe thereâs an open enough and we donât know what to call it. We donât have to call it open-source, but itâs open, transparent, shared source. I donât care what people call it.

**Hilary Doyle:** Rahul, can you explain SSPL and its impact on what weâre discussing?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** SSPL stands for Server Side Public License. The licensing terms basically state that if youâre offering a managed service, then you have to contribute back all of the infrastructure, all of the software, all of the UI, all of the monitoring code that you might have written back to the community.

**Hilary Doyle:** Okay, so, does SSPL really protect companies like Elastic and MongoDB?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Iâd say it depends. So scenario number one is that these products were created with SSPL from the get-go, in which case the answer is yes, it would protect them. However, most organizations have reactively adopted SSPL, in which case AWS always has a choice to fork off from the last open-source version and create their own open-source, like they did with Elasticâs. So I donât think it really protects most organizations that adopted SSPL retroactively.

**Hilary Doyle:** Okay, so, if Iâm AWS and Iâm using open-source from Mongo, I need to provide my infrastructure back to the community. Thatâs how SSPL works?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Correct. So MongoDB is under SSPL and therefore AWS, if they offered a managed service over MongoDB, would have to offer all of their monitoring infrastructure and everything else that they used to create that managed service, they will have to contribute that to open-source.

**Hilary Doyle:** Letâs talk about the practical application of that, though. MongoDB is open-source, it sits on the AWS platform, and AWS offers extremely similar databases, like Document and Dynamo. How do you feel about that?

**Matt Asay:** Hereâs me walking this fine line between, theyâre our partner and our competitor.

**Hilary Doyle:** Just jump, Matt. Just jump. Itâs only the three of us.

**Matt Asay:** I mean, honestly, I donât personally think DocumentDB is a very good product. Itâs hard to make a product that is intended to be a facsimile of something else. And thatâs no disrespect to AWS, thatâs just the nature of the beast.

AWS, and the cloud providers generally, are honestly a blessing and a curse, and I would say more blessing than a curse. The curse side is what we can all imagine. Theyâre competing with us. They offer similar products. The blessing is theyâre great partners. I donât know that thatâs always been the case. Elastic, at one point, I canât speak for them now, two years ago, I donât think they wouldâve said that AWS was a great partner.

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah, not a great partner. But things can change.

**Matt Asay:** Iâm not sure what they would say today, but for us, AWS has become a great partner. And the DocumentDB aspect of that little bit of friction, which was more pronounced, I think, two years ago; I would say, itâs not much today. Itâs there, and would we all be happier if it went away? Yeah, but itâs not a big deal. I mean, one of the reasons that itâs easy for us to work with AWS is that we donât. Aside from building some degree of compatibility with DocumentDB, they can take the code and they could go out and build MongoDB the second. But the change in license, frankly, has made it cleaner for us to work with them. Itâs made it easier. We donât have to go and say, âPlease do this.â We say, âWeâd love to work with you on code. We have mutual customers. And because of the license you have to work with us in a way. You have to give us that deference.â

Whereas I know other open-source companies, their code is open and all of the cloud providers that are building services around it, and it just makes it messy â because theyâre not in a strong position to be treated as an equal. They have to tin cup and say please versus meeting as equals.

**Hilary Doyle:** I have a question for both of you. Amazon is quintessentially capitalist. AWS has obviously learned that to keep its customers and its third party community happy, as you said, Matt, they have to give back and become a more active part of the software landscape that theyâre borrowing from. Itâs oppositional to corporate culture. How is this shift working for them, from both of your perspectives?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I completely agree that itâs a little bit of a shift for AWS in that Iâm starting to see a bunch of very interesting things happening on coordination between these product teams and the partner teams, because they really have started seeing that as their big engine for growth. So for example, the push that Iâve seen over the last two years on the marketplace side of things. For the longest period of time, it had near zero traction, but I wouldnât put it past AWS at some point of time, if they look at a product and say, this is really great and I think we could do better with this product, I would not put it past them to create another pizza team that goes after solving that one problem for the customers.

**Hilary Doyle:** Matt, how do you think AWS is dealing with this kind of shift in philosophy?

**Matt Asay:** Well, I do think for them, and for others, thereâs always that tension of, what can we build for our customers. On the open-source side, with companies like AWS, not exclusive AWS. But one thing that Iâve seen a significant change in â is this recognition that if you think of open-source as essential supply chain, then it becomes really important for them to be sensitive to the sources of those projects. Because think about it from the AWS perspective. If they did go in, âstrip mineâ a project, destroy the project in the process, that screws their customers, that screws everybody.

**Hilary Doyle:** Thanks for being with us, Matt. Really great to meet you.

**Matt Asay:** Thank you. Thanks for having me.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Thanks so much, Matt. This was a lot of fun.

**Hilary Doyle:** I know Matt was being very careful with his words in our conversation, and Rahul, you appeared to be loving everything he was saying, but I still think you guys were talking out of both sides of your mouths. Letâs safely assume that AWS has eaten a portion of the software landscape. Whether it continues to do this or not, you still havenât answered the second part of our question, which is, is this a good thing? Is it a good thing when a platform starts to eat its babies? Ugh, sorry, I will never use that phrase again.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Well, to me it actually sounds like a public service, so I stand on the other side of that argument. Theyâre taking something that is open-source, hard to manage yourself, and theyâre taking over and saying, âHey, hereâs a managed service for you. Go use it. Go leverage it. Use more of it,â and it makes those open-source projects popular. So why not? At the end of the day, the customers benefit from all these activities, they get lower pricing, they get amazing services, and it actually pushes the boundaries of technology.

**Hilary Doyle:** Okay, but letâs talk about Amazonâs marketing power for a minute. Thereâs no question it has a far greater capacity than really anyone else out there, and therefore a huge competitive advantage. AWS can present its own offerings ahead of everyone else, so when it comes to open-source and this idea of distribution, how is it fair that AWS is playing by the same rules as everyone else?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Well, thatâs not entirely true. Take the example of Snowflake. Snowflake is one of the hottest tech stocks in the market today, and they actually offer services on Amazon and they offer analytics services. Amazon has tons of their own software for analytics, but if you read the earnings report of Snowflake, they actually say Amazon was the biggest driver of sales for them and actually made them the success that they are.

**Hilary Doyle:** But isnât that just because AWS hasnât had an opportunity to build it themselves yet, and so itâs fine for Snowflake to be there for now?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Well, Snowflake is constantly going to try and outpace Amazon in their innovation.

**Hilary Doyle:** I donât know, sounds fishy to me, but yeah, sure. Weâll see at the next re:Invent if Selipsky marches out onto that stage and announces AWS Snowfall.

Rahul, for vendors looking to stay competitive and ahead of AWS, what is your advice to them? How can they succeed?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Okay, Hilary, usually I give very technical tips.

**Hilary Doyle:** Not today.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** But this time Iâm going to delve a little bit into product management.

**Hilary Doyle:** Thatâs what weâre talking about.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Here it goes. So first, every AWS service is a commodity service. You just have to get that in your head. Take a hard, critical look at what you have in your product and figure out how to replace it with an AWS service. The most important thing is to make sure that what you have left is truly valuable to the customers. That is your IP.

**Hilary Doyle:** So leverage all that AWS has to offer and do not build anything that AWS has or could have in their service catalog.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Exactly.

**Hilary Doyle:** Easy.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Second, if you find that you donât have intellectual property, then you better figure out a way to outpace AWS on their innovation cycle. Now, everything at AWS takes two to three years, which means you either need to always stay two

to three years ahead of them, or figure out a way to monetize and exit in two years.

**Hilary Doyle:** Got it. Two to three years is a lifetime in tech.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** As long as you can figure out how to monetize it.

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah, but itâs a decent head start. Okay, three, sorry.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** The third one is to find a niche that AWS just isnât interested in. And of course thatâs a very narrow niche, but you either do that or figure out something that is too far down their priority list. At the end of the day, AWS has finite resources and they will only work on what they think is important to them. So if you find that niche, you can stick with it and continue building that for a while.

**Hilary Doyle:** Can you give us a hint on what a niche might be? Are there areas that AWS just is never going to touch?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Hilary, are you asking me to give away the secrets to a million dollar business?

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah, of course I am. Fork them up.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** For later.

**Hilary Doyle:** Rahul, how much time do you spend on your phone every day?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Honestly, very little time, Hilary. But I think I know where youâre headed with this question, Hilary. So, the trend of our age, of course, is to have your head stuck in a phone 24/7, isnât it?

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah. I mean, listen, I am impressed and frankly very surprised by your phone hygiene. I definitely took you for a Wordle guy. But yeah, for the rest of us, we are living in a phone use epidemic â which is not surprising since phones can now do much of what we used to do on laptops. Thatâs thanks to the OGs: 3, 4, and now 5G. 5G has been an evolution for everyone. Itâs been a particular challenge for mobile providers. Before they could fully handle 5G, Verizon needed to address its scale, its compute, and its data. For the data piece, they chose a MongoDB/AWS combination.

Rahul, what was the thinking here and why the hybrid approach?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Verizon was using AWS Wavelength for 5G edge computing infrastructure, but they found databases werenât really natively supported there. So they went to MongoDBâs Atlas for deployment run and scale and MongoDB Realm to keep the data in sync across all these multiple devices, the users, the backends, and so on.

Now, this, among other things, led to, I think, something like a 47% improvement in their data transmission, and that was basically cutting way down on the latency that existed across all the 19 different AWS Wavelength zones. Now, Verizon is a really smart AWS customer, they know that a lot of the underlying core of 5G is commodity, and AWS too, at the same time, has launched a private 5G network deployment service where you can literally click a few buttons on the console and get all the infrastructure, including the SIM cards, delivered to your doorstep. And voila, you have your very own private 5G cell network with AWS managing everything for you.

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah, thatâs amazing.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Now, Verizon is doing everything it can to leverage AWS for these commodity services, but at the same time focusing on distribution and the OTT services and the content.

**Hilary Doyle:** So theyâre using AWS for plumbing and a third party solution and MongoDB for the fancy stuff. In this case, it isnât that AWS is eating the software landscapesâ lunch, theyâre just providing the bread.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Absolutely. And you get the butter.

**Hilary Doyle:** Iâll get the butter. Thatâs it for us for now. Weâll be back. Youâve been listening to AWS Insiders from CloudFix. Iâm Hilary Doyle.

Success Story

# Kingslake saves 10% annually with âset it and forget itâ AWS cost optimization from CloudFix

![Kingslake Success Story](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/kingslake-header.png)

> You can set it and forget it. There is absolutely no reason not to have CloudFix running.
>
> Dr. S. Dharmavasan
>
> Chairman of Kingslake

## How a multinational software company complements consultants with fast, easy AWS cost savings

_Founded in 1994, Kingslake builds and delivers software that brings agility to manufacturing. From increasing visibility of operations to improving customer service, inventory management to transportation logistics, Kingslake is dedicated to helping its clients excel._

Inspired by its breadth of solutions, partners, and customer locations, Kingslake turned to the cloud early. They develop all their offerings using cloud and cognitive technologies and pass their stackâs OpEx-based pricing on to their customers. AWS is their backbone â but like many companies, Kingslake found that as it scaled up, its costs became increasingly hard to manage. Kingslake and the companies it serves needed a simple, cost-effective way to control their AWS spend.

## âIt all comes back to managing costsâ: As AWS scales up, so does its spend

As the Chairman of Kingslake, Dr. S. Dharmavasan (Dharma to his friends) regularly consults with multinational companies that are household names â and heâs seen firsthand how AWS is transforming their businesses.

Heâs also seen, however, how quickly costs can rise. âMajor companies are using AWS for their most strategic business initiatives,â Dharma said. âAWS is so affordable and powerful to get started that the department heads dive straight in. Eventually, though, it all has to come back to managing costs.â

One of the most challenging parts of managing costs: keeping up with the sheer volume of AWS savings recommendations. According to Dharma, âWith all these communications coming out of AWS, no one can keep up anymore.â Itâs virtually impossible to not only track the latest updates, but manually implement them as well.

## Kingslake and its customers save 10% on their annual AWS spend with CloudFix

Kingslake discovered CloudFix through its partnership with Aurea. Dharma and his team now use it themselves and recommend it even to their largest customers â all of whom save an average of 10% on their AWS spend. âMost companies arenât using AWS as efficiently as they could be. Thatâs where CloudFix comes in,â Dharma said. âCloudFix brings every instance together to centrally manage how much you are using and spending.â

> Itâs incredibly simple to set up â it was a bit like just turning on an iPhone and letting it self-configure.

Dharma also likes how CloudFix makes it easy to keep up with the deluge of savings recommendations â and how easy it is to implement. âCloudFix keeps up with the bulletins and finds and fixes your top AWS-recommended savings opportunities. Plus, itâs incredibly simple to set up. It was like turning on an iPhone and letting it self-configure,â Dharma continued.

For Kingslake and its clients, CloudFix plays a vital role in a larger AWS savings strategy. Dharma explained, âBig companies tend to turn to consultants to look for AWS savings. CloudFix often makes more sense. Itâs more affordable, it runs in the background, and it finds

and fixes only Amazonâs approved recommendations, so you know itâs safe.â

Perhaps Kingslakeâs favorite thing about CloudFix? âYou just set it and forget it,â Dharma said. âThere is absolutely no reason to not have CloudFix running. Itâs like virus scanning or malware protection, except itâs constantly fine-tuning AWS to implement Amazonâs latest recommended fixes. You can save your consultant budget for more complex projects.â

## With CloudFix, Kingslake simplifies and streamlines AWS cost savings

At Kingslake, Dharma has big plans for CloudFix. âWeâre excited to help take CloudFix even broader across Asia, entering countries like Malaysia and beyond,â Dharma concluded. âThis will have tremendous value to medium and large businesses who have been using consultants. Even if it saves you 10 percent, that is a substantial savings on a very large number.â

Success Story

# Valentâs small IT team achieves big savings with CloudFix

![Valent headquarters](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Valent-headquarters-1.jpg)

> CloudFix is a no-brainer. Any AWS users who are struggling with ballooning costs â CloudFix is the way to go.

## How a sustainable agriculture company automated its way to more time and lower costs

_Headquartered in San Ramon, California, Valent develops and markets agricultural products that integrate biorational, botanical, and traditional chemistry approaches. Its mission is bold: advance sustainable agriculture, protect crops, enhance crop yields, improve food quality, beautify the environment, and safeguard public health._

With worldwide operations and customers, and little on-site infrastructure, moving to AWS was an easy choice for Valent. A multi-year digital transformation journey resulted in more than 90% of the companyâs infrastructure running on the cloud, but as adoption grew, so did costs. Valent needed a way to streamline and automate AWS cost optimization so its slim IT team could focus on delivering business value. Thatâs when they found CloudFix.

## The benefits of AWS keep growing â but so does the cost

The Valent team chose AWS for its breadth of offerings, speed to implementation, and resources to support its R&D team. âMoving away from hardware infrastructure to AWS lets us be much more agile,â said Mike Cortez, Valentâs lead IT infrastructure architect. âItâs central to our digital transformation initiative and important to our research team, too. AWS not only supports our IT objectives, its genetics layers play a key role in R&D for our products.â

> AWS is central to our digital transformation initiative and important to our research team, too. It not only supports our IT objectives, its genetics layers play a key role in R&D for our products.

For Valent, the benefits of AWS kept growing â but so did the price. âWe learned quickly that the âlift and shiftâ model was not very cost effective,â Cortez continued. âItâs not like-kind to like-kind and doesnât take into account differences in sizing. We ended up with a ton of wasted space but couldnât reduce our volumes, so our costs were out of control.â

Cortez and his team hired an AWS managed service provider to help with cost optimization, but while the third-party helped identify savings opportunities, it was up to Valent to put them into practice. Cortez shared, âWe could use their tools to review things like right-sizing and changing volume types, but it was all manual. It took a tremendous amount of time and energy to implement them. It just wasnât sustainable, especially for our small team.â

## Valent saves time and money with CloudFixâs automated fixes

Cortez learned about CloudFix from his AWS rep, and was immediately drawn to the ability to automate AWS-recommended fixes. The initial CloudFix savings assessment found almost $30,000 in savings by [switching from gp2 to gp3](https://cloudfix.com/blog/migrate-gp2-to-gp3-better-performance-lower-costs/) alone. âI wish I had CloudFix sooner!â Cortez said. âWe were manually moving from gp2 to gp3, but this is 1000% easier and faster.â With the work the team had completed prior to CloudFix, plus impact of the CloudFix fix, Valent now saves approximately $40,000 per month on Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes alone.

Implementing CloudFix was fast and easy as well. According to Cortez, âCloudFix and our managed service provider came together and deployed it seamlessly. There were no bumps that werenât ironed out in the first 30 minutes. Itâs very straightforward to set up and use.â

> AWS is a monster; I canât keep up with all the advisories. Being able to automatically implement the latest recommendations is game-changing.

The Valent team particularly appreciates the automated nature of CloudFix. âWe run a very lean environment and I have to be able to automate as much as I can,â Cortez commented. âAWS is a monster; I canât keep up with all the advisories. Being able to automatically implement the latest recommendations is game-changing.â

Best of all: CloudFix takes AWS cost optimization off of Cortezâs plate so he can work on business-critical initiatives. âTime is very valuable. To be able to save that much time so I can focus on more value-added work is a huge thing, above and beyond the dollar figure. That time back is very much appreciated,â he added.

## âItâs a no-brainerâ: Valent doubles down on AWS with its savings from CloudFix

Whatâs next for Valent, AWS, and CloudFix? Cortez plans to optimize additional Amazon EBS volumes and to keep using his favorite feature â the âalways fixâ button â to save more time than ever. The team also intends to reinvest the time and savings delivered by CloudFix into expanding further into AWS. Cortez concluded, âCloudFix is a no-brainer. Any AWS users who are struggling with ballooning costs â CloudFix is the way to go.â

Success Story

# Tokara Solutions instantly cuts AWS costs by 10% with CloudFix

![Tokara Solutions Success Story](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/tokara-solutions-header-2.png)

> Instantly saved 10%
>
> My favorite thing about CloudFix? It saves us money.
>
> Shawn Grant
>
> President, Tokara Solutions

## The CRM consulting business replaced manual AWS cost optimization with automated savings from CloudFix

_Tokara Solutionsâ tagline is âCRM done rightâ â and they take it very seriously. A global team of CRM consultants and engineers, Tokara brings together people, processes, and technology to maximize business value and build trusted, long-term relationships. Its seasoned team of CRM professionals averages 15+ years of experience and is dedicated to helping clients accelerate business by putting the customer first._

Shawn Grant, President of Tokara Solutions, is an AWS superfan. He doesnât just use AWS for his own companyâs infrastructure; he encourages even his largest enterprise clients to migrate. But each month, when Tokaraâs AWS bill arrived, he felt like he could be paying significantly less. Grant needed a way to reduce Tokaraâs AWS spend without a lengthy consulting engagement â and with CloudFix, he found it.

## âThe bill was too highâ: Tokara looks for an automated AWS cost optimization solution

For Grant, the challenge was simple: âI would get an AWS bill, and it would be too high.â Even as someone who was all-in on AWS, cost control had become difficult. âThe AWS services are worth every penny,â Grant continued. âBut if we optimized how we ran each instance, I knew we could save a lot of money.â

The Tokara team first tried to tackle AWS cost optimization manually. They attempted to read all the AWS bulletins and implement each recommended fix, but Hector Santos, Tokaraâs Director of Professional Services, admits even he couldnât keep up.

âWith how quickly AWS releases updates, changes just come too quick. If you are running 50-plus servers and creating new instances left and right, your people canât maintain it anymore. There is a better use of their time and resources.â Santos said. It was critical for the Tokara team to focus on its mission â CRM done right â and not waste time on manual updates.

## Why Tokara chose CloudFix: Easy to deploy, easy to use, instant savings

Tokara considered multiple solutions for AWS cost optimization, but landed on CloudFix. The team chose it based on two essential criteria: ease of deployment and ease of action.

âIt practically sets itself up,â Santos said. âIt was fast and safe to connect our AWS account and let CloudFix run. It takes all the hard work out of finding and fixing the optimizations that AWS recommends that would just be too time consuming to perform manually.â Plus, CloudFix is constantly adding new finders and fixers â keeping up with the incredible volume of technical recommendation bulletins being published by AWS.

> CloudFix lets us review and implement the latest recommendations in a few clicks.

For Grant, these regular new fixers were one of the strongest selling points. âWe get hit up all the time by different vendors for high-dollar AWS savings consultations or to try other tools that just recommend savings improvements, but you still have to implement them manually,â Grant shared. âCloudFix lets us review and implement the latest recommendations in a few clicks. Thatâs huge.â

## CloudFix instantly saves Tokara 10% on its annual AWS spend

What impact did CloudFix make on Tokaraâs AWS budget?

âCloudFix instantly saved us 10% of our overall AWS spend,â Grant continued. âI know Hector (Santos) feels better about showing me the bill every month.â

At Tokara, where they regularly consult on CRM projects with major enterprises, theyâre already thinking beyond using CloudFix internally.

âI envision us recommending CloudFix to our own customer base,â Grant said. âAny growing enterprise will quickly get to the point where they have too many AWS instances to manage

manually. Thatâs when CloudFix steps up, makes ongoing management easy, and results in real cost savings.â

Grant concluded, âMy favorite thing about CloudFix? It saves us money. Honestly, if you are running 10 to 15 servers in AWS, there is no reason not to be using CloudFix.â

> It takes all the hard work out of finding and fixing the optimizations that AWS recommends.

## Connâs HomePlus Savings
**Announcing CloudFix AI**: AI-powered step-by-step guidance to implement advanced savings. [Check it out!](https://cloudfix.com/new-cloudfix-ai-chrome-extension/)

â

Success Story

# Connâs HomePlus achieves nonstop savings with CloudFix

![Connâs HomePlus store front](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Conns-store-front.jpg)

> $85k saved in the first few weeks
>
> We just set it and forget it.
>
> How the billion-dollar retailer dramatically reduces their AWS spend.

### About Connâs

Founded in 1890, Connâs HomePlus started as a small mom-and-pop plumbing and heating company in Beaumont, Texas. Over the next 130 years, the company grew into one of the leading retailers of furniture, appliances, and consumer electronics in the Southern U.S., operating over 160 stores in 15 states, with over 4,100 employees.

Their guiding vision: that everyone deserves a home they love. To make that possible, Connâs offers some of the best customer benefits in the industry âÂ including unmatched, personalized payment options for everyone.

This âcustomer-firstâ focus runs deep at Connâs HomePlus âÂ so deep that itâs the first thing Jeremy Anderson, Cloud Architect at Connâs, mentions: âMy job is helping our company save money where we can so we can make bigger investments in our customer experience, so we can keep making bigger investments in our customer experience. Using CloudFix enables us to find and fix the biggest AWS savings opportunities.â

### AWS powers digital transformation â at an unexpectedly high cost

Connâs HomePlus began their move to AWS 4 years ago for a common reason. âThe whole premise of moving to the cloud was to reduce operational costsâ Anderson said.

Two other initiatives made the move to the cloud (and controlling spend) even more urgent. âFirst, when Covid hit, we had to get people working at home as quickly as possible. At the same time, we were undergoing a huge digital transformation âÂ adding major website modernizations to make it easier to place and track orders, and new ways for customers to pay online,â Anderson said.

With this new cloud innovation came a big surge in AWS spending âÂ and the need for a solution like CloudFix to easily and automatically contain the costs.

âHonestly, we were expecting the cost to be lower after we migrated from on-prem to IaaS, but we discovered that in the cloud, storage and compute gets very pricey,â Anderson said. âSo we went searching for the best way to optimize AWS costs.â

> CloudFix actually fixes things, not just finds them. The team keeps on top of releasing new fixers that generate new savings for us regularly â and theyâre all based on guidance from AWS, so we donât have to focus on whether the recommendations are good or not. They just inherently are.

### Finding (and achieving) instant AWS savings

Connâs HomePlus discovered CloudFix at an AWS conference and decided to try it. âWe started with a few of our higher spend accounts,â Anderson said. âCloudFix instantly found significant savings by transitioning our storage from Amazon Elastic Block Store GP2 to GP3. So we decided to let CloudFix find and fix savings across all of our AWS accounts, and thatâs when we really started saving money.â

Before CloudFix, Anderson and team tried a range of other solutions. âNative AWS tools for optimizing costs just arenât as accurate as we need them to be . . . and you have to be the doctor, looking at the problems meticulously to see if the recommendations are correct,â Anderson said.

Thatâs his favorite part of saving with CloudFix. âCloudFix actually fixes things, not just finds them,â Anderson said. âThe team keeps on top of releasing new fixers that generate new savings for us regularly âÂ and theyâre all based on guidance from AWS, so we donât have to focus on whether the recommendations are good or not. They just inherently are.â

### Set it, forget it, and let the savings compound

According to Anderson, âyou really do just âset CloudFix and forget it.â CloudFix constantly looks at our new resources and finds and fixes opportunities to save on our AWS spend.â

For Connâs HomePlus, the CloudFix implementation was incredibly easy, with zero safety concerns. âThe ease was fantastic. I literally went into our AWS management account, allowed a few AWS-approved permissions, and that was it.â

Within a matter of minutes, CloudFix scanned every AWS instance across the entire Connâs HomePlus infrastructure. âIt was off to the races at that point,â Anderson said. âCloudFix just went to work finding and fixing big savings opportunities.â

On the first day, they found $10,000 in savings. That ballooned to over $85,000 in a matter of weeks. As the savings compound, Connâs HomePlus expects to save much more over the next several years.

### Today, Connâs HomePlus finds savings nonstop

What does non-stop savings mean to Anderson, and to his Cloud Architecture team at Connâs HomePlus? âWe expect CloudFix to save us a tremendous amount of money with very little effort. Weâre counting on the team to keep rolling out incredible new fixers. Most of the other AWS savings tools we tried promised this, but CloudFix actually delivered.â

His advice for other companies considering CloudFix: âI would tell them the (CloudFix) savings far outweigh the priceâ

> CloudFix saves us a tremendous amount of money with very little effort. Weâre counting on the team to keep rolling out incredible new fixers. Most of the other AWS savings tools we tried promised this, but CloudFix actually delivered.

# Autoscale Amazon Kinesis Streams for AWS Cost Savings

CloudFix Team

June 16, 2022

![Autoscale Amazon Kinesis Streams for AWS Cost Savings](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Generic14.png)

If you use AWS Kinesis, you know that provisioned mode is dramatically cheaper than the on-demand mode. However, provisioned mode requires you to provision the number of shards necessary to satisfy your appâs write and request rate. Provisioned data streams are ideal for predictable application traffic.

## Finding savings: What is optimize mode?

In provisioned mode, you are only charged for:

- Volume of data written to a shard
- Per-hour charge for each shard

So for one shard running on maximum utilization processing 30 TB of data per year would cost **$149.40**.

Processing 30 TB of data per year using max utilization in on-Demand mode would cost **$4,036.80**.

### Optimizing shards

Selecting the right number of shards is critical as over-provisioning would lead to unnecessary costs, while under-provisioning would result in throttled data processing. In reality, there is rarely a constant stream of data, thus the ability to dynamically adjust the number of shards is essential.

Unfortunately, AWS does not provide a way to automatically set the optimal number of shards.

## Realizing savings: How optimized mode lowers your costs

For most applications, we recommend a combination of provisioned and on-demand modes.

For example, if your data streams have predictable demand during working hours, you can use a simple Lambda function to a certain capacity in provisioned mode. Then, when there is reduced and less predictable demand at night, switch to on-demand mode.

To create our own autoscaling for optimized Kinesis pricing, CloudFix creates a formula that measures demand and responds dynamically to data stream capacity needs. You can read [more detailed information here](https://awsmadeeasy.com/blog/kinesis-stream/), including instructions on how to implement this optimization model to optimize shards in your Kinesis data streams today.

## Optimizing savings: Optimize Kinesis Data Streams with CloudFix

With our guide above, someone on your engineering team can write a function to optimize Kinesis modes, starting today.

But what about next week? And the week after? Will this function continue to be the most optimal for your future data streaming requirements?

CloudFix can help manage your ongoing Amazon Kinesis costs by providing a simple and elegant solution for automatically and dynamically setting the optimal number shards now and in the future.

## Finding savings: What is AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering?

Finding opportunities to save money on your AWS bill is crucial for businesses. If you are using AWS S3 storage then you should also have Intelligent-Tiering turned on for each bucket. There is no risk of down time and you can save considerably on your costs. Below is a quick overview.

**AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering:**

- Is completely automated.
- Monitors data access and automatically moves objects to cheaper storage tiers, if they have not been recently accessed.
- Provides instant retrieval â there is no performance impact or service degradation.
- Can be enabled on all buckets (pricing updates released in [September 2021](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-s3-intelligent-tiering-automates-storage-savings/) eliminated the minimum storage duration and monitoring costs for small objects).


Works easily with existing lifecycle policies. When there are multiple policies for a bucket, AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering will optimize for costs.
- Requires no changes to the application. Data in the S3 is accessed as usual.
- Can provide between 18% and 37% cost savings!

## Realizing savings: How AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering lowers costs

To understand how AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering actually works, you can read [more details here](https://awsmadeeasy.com/blog/aws-s3-intelligent-tiering/). You will also find instructions on how to manually fix each instance of your AWS S3 Buckets. Itâs important to note that doing this manually will be effective, but probably not efficient.

## Optimizing savings: Optimize AWS S3 more efficiently with CloudFix

Realistically, modern businesses need efficient solutions that are also cost effective. That is why we built CloudFix. CloudFix optimizes your AWS account safely by regularly monitoring usage and cost, searching for opportunities to realize risk-free savings. Not only does CloudFix monitor for these opportunities, but it will also fix them for you. This means that you can now be efficient as well as effective.

CloudFix not only monitors to look for S3 Intelligent-Tiering opportunities, but it also monitors for numerous others. Pulling from AWSâ own advisory blog for risk-free solutions, CloudFix filters through potential savings opportunities to find and present the right ones for your business. Introducing CloudFix to your business will optimize your AWS space to be more efficient, have better performance, and save you money.

# Reduce Your Cloud Spend and Improve Performance with AWS gp3 EBS Volumes

![Reduce Your Cloud Spend and Improve Performance with AWS gp3 EBS Volumes](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Generic-4-1.png)

If you donât already have someone in your organization focused on FinOps, itâs probably time to get started. AWS cost optimization can be an overwhelming topic. In this article, we cover a common use case where you can start taking action almost immediately. If your organization deploys applications to EC2 instances, then you likely have this opportunity in place right now.

EC2 instances often use general purpose Solid State Drive (SSD) EBS (Elastic Block Store) storage volumes. Until late last year, the standard general porpuse type was gp2. That changed at re:Invent 2020 whenÂ [AWS announced the next-generation general purpose SSD volumes called gp3](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ebs-gp3-volume-lets-you-provision-performance-separate-from-capacity-and-offers-20-lower-price/).

EBS volumes are disk drives attached to your EC2 instances. Their lifecycle is not tied to the instance, meaning they can persist beyond the shutdown of your virtual machines. SSD general purpose volumes work well with a variety of workloads, and they offer a good balance of price and performance.

AWS delivers on their principle of customer obsession here by providing a better value than gp2 without sacrificing performance. In fact,Â [not only are gp3 volumes less expensive, they offer higher maximum throughput rates](https://cloudfix.com/ssd-aws-gp3-ebs-volumes/). Thus, you should seriously consider making this upgrade In the vast majority of cases. See below for more information on exception cases where it may not be beneficial.

### Wait, this must be too good to be true â¦

Where is the catch, you ask? Well, there doesnât seem to be one. You get these benefits from gp3 while at the same time maintaining the same stringent levels of durability and availability. Additionally, a nice feature is the ability to provision IOPS and throughput separate from the storage capacity.

At CloudFix, we thoroughly tested this upgrade opportunity and strongly recommend [migrating gp2 volumes with less than 3000 IOPS to gp3](https://cloudfix.com/blog/migrate-gp2-to-gp3-better-performance-lower-costs/). You can realize savings of approximately 20% on an annual basis by performing this migration, as gp3 volumes cost $0.08 / GB compared to $0.10 / GB for gp2.

There is little downside because your performance will be as good or better than your current gp2 volumes. The performance numbers for both types can be found in theÂ [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#solid-state-drives).

Furthermore, there is a straightforward, in-place migration path. No downtime is required to take advantage of this upgrade in the vast majority of cases.

### Are There Cases Where I Should Not Upgrade?

There are still a few cases where it may not be beneficial to upgrade your gp2 volumes.

Some uncommon cases include older EC2 instances launched before November 2016 that requireÂ [initialization of elastic attachments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/requesting-ebs-volume-modifications.html#initialize-modification-support). Unfortunately, this step requires some downtime because you need to either detach/attach the volume or else stop/start the instance.

The ideal migration candidate is a volume for which peak IOPS is less than 3000 and peak throughput is less than 125 MB/s. The baseline IOPS of gp3 is always 3000 IOPS. If your requirements are between 3000 and 16000 IOPS, then use gp3 but also provision the additional IOPS required. This effectively raises the cost up to $0.095 / GB, but there are still some savings to be gained. If you need more than 16000 IOPS, use io2 instead.

Finally, short-lived volumes that are only around for a week or two may not be worth the effort.

### Migration Procedures

There are two migration approaches to consider. The first option is to conduct the migrations manually using the following procedure:

1. Select the gp2 volume in the AWS console
2. Verify the volume was created after 3 Novermber, 2016. Volumes created prior to this date require downtime to migrate.
3. Verify the volumeâs IOPS is less than 3,000 (Read IOPS Sum + Write IOPS Sum for each minute should be less than 180,000, i.e. 3000 x 60)
4. Verify the throughput is less than 125 Mbps (Read Bytes Sum + Write Bytes Sum for each minutes should be less than 7500, i.e. 125 x 60)
5. If both of these conditions are met, continue and use either the AWS console or CLI to modify the volume.
6. Repeat these steps for each volume

The EC2 console allows you to make the modification to the volume. Select your desired EBS volume and choose the Modify action. You will see a dialog similar to one shown below. Change the drop down value to gp3 and click Modify.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/ModifyVolume-gp2.png)

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/ModifyVolume-gp3.png)

Your volumes are migrated in place with no downtime. If you need to rollback, you can modify the property using the same technique to go back to gp2. As an extra precaution, we recommend taking a snapshot of the EBS gp2 volume before performing the migration.

Alternatively, you can use the EC2 CLI (or API) using the following command:

```

```

This approach works for a small number of volumes, however it can be time consuming and error prone. An alternative is to sign up for a freeÂ [CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/demo/)Â account and automate the process in a few minutes. CloudFix easily scales to handle large numbers of volumes and performs safe upgrades, automated upgrades.

CloudFix automatically monitors your account, identifies migration opportunities, and safely modifies volumes with the click of a button. It also takes a backup snapshot before the migration as a best practice.

Browse toÂ [CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/demo/)Â and create a free account. Setup monitoring on your AWS account by clicking Run Template. This creates the IAM role used by CloudFix.

Review the recommendations on the dashboard and select one or more volumes to migrate. Click the Play button to perform the migrations now or the Schedule button to have CloudFix run them during a maintenance window. You can migrate selected volumes, or simply select all to apply all recommended migrations with one click.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/DashboardSavings.png)

Saving 20% with no performance degradation or downtime sounds like a pretty good deal, and it is. You should give serious consideration to making the upgrade where applicable based on the criteria discussed above. In the vast majority of cases, the migration will be beneficial in the end. To top it all off, your FinOps career will also be off to a good start!

# Introducing CloudFixâs Newest Addition: The EMR Instance Optimizer

![Stephen Barr](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/stephen-barr_blog.jpg)

Stephen BarrPrincipal Architect and Technical Evangelist

January 23, 2024

![Introducing CloudFixâs Newest Addition: The EMR Instance Optimizer](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/FIxerBlogImage-2.png)

Hey AWS enthusiasts and cost-conscious developers! Weâve got some electrifying news thatâll spark your interest and ignite your AWS budget optimization efforts. Today, weâre excited to announce the latest breakthrough in our suite of automated solutions at CloudFix â the **EMR Instance Optimizer**!

As a leader in cloud resource management, CloudFix is always on the hunt for new ways to help you streamline your AWS spending. Our innovative collection of Finder/Fixers has already paved the way for significant savings across various AWS services. But we didnât stop there.

In this blog post, we are going to discuss:

1. [What is Elastic Map Reduce, and how is it priced?](https://cloudfix.com/blog/introducing-emr-instance-optimizer/#what-is-elastic-map-reduce-and-how-is-it-priced-)
2. [What leads to EMR overspend?](https://cloudfix.com/blog/introducing-emr-instance-optimizer/#what-leads-to-emr-overspend)
3. [How does the EMR finder/fixer work?](https://cloudfix.com/blog/introducing-emr-instance-optimizer/#how-does-the-emr-instance-optimizer-finder-fixer-work)
4. [Using CloudFix for Automated Savings](https://cloudfix.com/blog/introducing-emr-instance-optimizer/#using-cloudfix-for-automated-savings)

Lets jump into the details and learn more about Elastic Map Reduce.

## What is Elastic Map Reduce, and how is it priced?

Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) is a cloud-based big data processing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to process large amounts of data using popular frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Presto.

The name, Elastic Map Reduce, comes from theÂ [MapReduce algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce), which is a strategy for large scale parallel processing on a class of workloads commonly classified as _embarrassingly parallel_. For example, generating a set of _preview images_ for an image gallery is as simple as generating a preview image for each image in the gallery â this would be _embarrassingly parallel._ Another example would be a simulation, e.g. simulating the outcome of a card game; in the Map step, the game is initialized with a particular starting configuration and simulated, and in the Reduce step the average result across all simulations is calculated.

In addition to the Algorithm, Map Reduce was also part of the _Hadoop_ project, which emerged out of Yahoo in the mid 2000âs _._ A great history of Hadoop can be seen in this article here, [_A Brief History of Big Data_](https://towardsdatascience.com/2003-2023-a-brief-history-of-big-data-25712351a6bc). Hadoop, which was eventually moved to the Apache Software Foundation, is still used today, although it has mostly been superseded by Apache Spark or Apache Hive, and Presto. Hadoop, although open source, was quite difficult to configure. You needed a dedicated cluster, and getting the correct version of every library, the Java Virtual Machine, and all of the required dependencies was tricky to manage.

This difficulty in setting up Hadoop was Amazonâs opportunity. AWSÂ [launched Elastic Map Reduce](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/04/02/announcing-amazon-elastic-mapreduce/) in 2009. In AWS terms, this is an ancient service. Given the AWS services which existed at the time, namely S3, EC2, SQS, and SimpleDB, these services were the building blocks on the higher level offerings. Elastic Map Reduce was one of the first high level managed services. Notably, Amazon RDS launched around the same time. EMR has continued to evolve, most notably to expand to support other cluster compute applications such as Apache Spark, Apache HBase, and Apache Hive, and Hue.

A small overview of new EMR features include:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Feature** | **Launch Date or Year** |
| Spot Instances Integration | 2011 |
| EMR File System (EMRFS) | 2014 |
| Support for Apache Spark | June 2014 |
| Integration with AWS Glue Data Catalog | 2017 |
| EMR Notebooks | November 2018 |
| Automated Provisioning with AWS Lake Formation | 2019 |
| Serverless Option (EMR on AWS Outposts) | 2019 |
| EMR Studio | December 2020 |
| Amazon EMR on EKS | December 2020 |
| EMR Containers | December 2020 |
| Managed Scaling | Evolved over time |
| Security Enhancements (Encryption, IAM Integration) | Evolved over time |
| Fine-Grained Access Control | Evolved over time |
| Cross-Account Cluster Access | Evolved over time |

### EMR Pricing

The pricing for EMR is based on a few key factors:

1. **Instance Types**: EMR allows you to choose from a variety of instance types, each with its own pricing structure. You can select instances optimized for compute, memory, storage, or a balance of all three, depending on your specific needs.
2. **Instance Hours**: With EMR, you pay for the number of hours your instances are running. This means that you have full control over when to start and stop your clusters, allowing you to optimize costs by only paying for the resources you actually need.
3. **Additional Services**: Depending on your use case, you may need additional services such as Amazon S3 for storing input and output data, or Amazon DynamoDB for real-time data processing. The pricing for these services is separate from the EMR pricing and should be taken into account when calculating your overall costs.

To more succinctly summarize, the compute portion of EMR jobs is the EC2 cost, plus an EMR premium, which varies based on the instance type. It is on average a 22% premium, but can be as low as 12% and as high as 27%. For details, see theÂ [EMR on Amazon EC2 Pricing Page](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=4). Note that you can also run EMR on EKS, on Serverless,

## What leads to EMR overspend?

EMR overspend is similar in nature to EC2 overspend. As stated earlier, EMR is effectively a preconfigured cluster of EC2 instances. The size of these instances was chosen at a given point in time, based on criteria which were appropriate at the time. For example, a user may have chosen an oversized instance to make sure that their job worked, with the intention of right-sizing it later. However, once the job is done it is easy to move on to the next task. Engineers are busy enough as it is, and they often are not properly incentivized to optimize for costs. Another possibility is that the cluster instances were sized for a particular type of workload, and the nature of the workload itself has changed. For example, the simulation code over time may use less memory than before, and therefore a compute-optimized instance or general instance may be more cost effective than a memory optimized instance.

In any case, the benefits of right-sizing EMR instances are similar to the benefits of right-sizing EC2 instances, but the payoff is multiplied by the size of the cluster. For example, if you are running 10 EMR instances of type m7a.24xlarge to m7a.16xlarge, you would realize the following savings:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | EC2 Price | EMR Price | Hourly Price | Per Month |
| m7a.16xlarge | $3.71 | $0.93 | $4.64 | $33,384.96 |
| m7a.24xlarge | $5.56 | $1.39 | $6.96 | $50,077.44 |
| **Savings on retyping 10 instances for 1 month** |  |  |  | **$16,692.48** |

The âPer Monthâ cost is calculated as 10 instances running 24 hours per day for a 30 day month. Note that the retyping of an instance is to the next smallest size. This is a 33% drop in price!

## How does the EMR Instance Optimizer Finder/Fixer work?

The EMR instance optimizer Finder/Fixer works though a tried and true algorithm. Namely:

1. Use the Cost and Usage Report to find EC2 instances belonging to EMR clusters
2. Query Compute Optimizer for potential savings
3. Exclude recommendations of rightsizing to nano/micro instances, exclude high risk recommendations, and exclude recommendations where the potential savings are < 2%
4. If savings meet this criterion, the user must execute the change. At present, this is called a _Manual Fixer_ in that the fix must be manually executed by the user, rather than utilize through AWS Change Manger.
5. **Realize cost savings!**

It is a straightforward algorithm, and you can read more details in our [EC2 Right-sizing Finder/Fixer blog post](https://cloudfix.com/blog/cut-costs-right-sizing-aws-ec2-instances/). The key part is that CloudFix will surface a recommendation. The data in the recommendation include an Instance ID, Emr Cluster Id, and the target instance type.

For Elastic Map Reduce, you cannot dynamically change the type of the EC2 instance. Instead, you should terminate your existing cluster, change the instance type, start a new cluster, and direct future jobs to the new cluster. If your EMR is managed by a CloudFormation template, it will look similar to the following:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'AWS CloudFormation Sample Template: EMR Cluster'

Resources:
  MyEMRCluster:
    Type: 'AWS::EMR::Cluster'
    Properties:
      Name: MyEMRCluster
      ReleaseLabel: emr-6.4.0
      Applications:
        - Name: Hadoop
        - Name: Spark
      Instances:
        MasterInstanceGroup:
          InstanceCount: 1
          InstanceType: m5.4xlarge
          Market: ON_DEMAND
        CoreInstanceGroup:
          InstanceCount: 10
          InstanceType: m5.4xlarge
          Market: ON_DEMAND
      JobFlowRole: EMR_EC2_DefaultRole
      ServiceRole: EMR_DefaultRole
      VisibleToAllUsers: true

Outputs:
  ClusterId:
    Description: The Cluster ID
    Value: !Ref MyEMRCluster

## Using CloudFix for Automated Savings

Using CloudFix is the easiest way to realize automatic savings for your EMR clusters. Within the CloudFix interface, this finder/fixer is called âEMR Optimize Instancesâ tab. Once you have found a recommendation, you must update the cluster configuration and relaunch the cluster with the suggested new instance type.

![AWS Foundational Skills: How to get started with CloudWatch](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Foundation-Blog-Cool.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the first post of our new blog series: Foundation blogs. These blogs will provide detailed supplemental information that complements the finder/fixer processes covered in our Fixer blog series. Think of Foundation blogs like reference material â the useful background knowledge that you need to achieve meaningful, ongoing AWS savings.

Up first: Amazon CloudWatch. Our inaugural Foundation blog will go over the CloudWatch basics: what it is, how to make sure itâs installed, how to configure it correctly, and how to monitor CloudWatch metrics. We will also talk about how to respond to CloudWatch alarms with Lambda functions, as well as details about the CloudWatch agent. Consider it your CloudWatch starter packâ¦ now letâs get started.

## 1\. CloudWatch fundamentals: metrics, statistics, alarms, and dashboards

Letâs kick it off with an analogy. Say we think of AWS architectures as living organisms. The high-level services like EC2, S3, DynamoDB, RDS, and Lambda would be the key organsâ¦ the heart, lungs, stomach, liver, etc. In this analogy, Amazon CloudWatch is the nervous system. CloudWatch gathers metrics from all of the different AWS services, aggregates and summarizes this data, and takes action if necessary.

The insights and actions delivered by CloudWatch enable us to implement a variety of automatic optimizations. For example, just like our nervous system causes us to sweat when weâre exercising, CloudWatch can trigger an alarm to cause autoscaling actions on EC2 instances when there are high levels of load. This capability makes it a key component of many of our CloudFix finder/fixers.

### 1.1 CloudWatch metrics and statistics

CloudWatch uses metrics and statistics to monitor AWS services.

A CloudWatch metric is a particular quantity thatâs being monitored. At first, CloudWatch only monitored EC2 instances, with metrics like CPU load, disk I/O, and network I/O. As the number of AWS services increased, so did the metrics that CloudWatch could keep track of. Services such as EBS, RDS, ELB, SQS, SNS, Lambda, and others now include basic metrics that are automatically sent to CloudFix at no charge as part of the [CloudWatch free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/). Example metrics for Lambda, for instance, include `Invocations`, `Duration`, `Errors`, `Throttles`, `ConcurrentExecutions`, etc., and are monitored for every Lambda function by default.

`Statistics` are CloudWatchâs aggregation of metrics. For example, if you are looking at a statistic like `CPUUtilization`, you may be interested in the `average` value of that metric over a certain amount of time. You could use CloudWatch statistics to compute this. For more information, have a look at [CloudWatch statistics definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html).

### 1.2 CloudWatch metric alarms and composite alarms

CloudWatch alarms are the means of taking action based on the behavior of CloudWatch metrics. Alarms take CloudWatch metrics as input, do aggregations based on these metrics, and publish messages to SNS topics.

There are two types of CloudWatch alarms: metric alarms and composite alarms. A metric alarm looks at either a metric ( `CPUUtilization`) or a statistic of a metric (average `CPUUtilization`).

A composite alarm can take other alarms as input. For instance, if you had two metric alarms monitoring `CPUUtilization` and `MemoryUtilization` (this would require the CloudWatch Agent, more on that in a bit), then you could create a composite alarm that monitored both individual alarms. This `HighCPUHighMemory` composite alarm would be triggered only if both CPU usage and memory usage are high (with âhighâ defined in the details of the two metric alarms). This can help you manage your resources more effectively by reducing the number of false alarms and allowing you to act on more meaningful combined alarms.

### 1.3 CloudWatch dashboards

CloudWatch not only gathers data, it helps you aggregate and visualize it. With CloudWatch, you can monitor across accounts and across regions. Have a look at [AWSâs cross-account cross-region dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_xaxr_dashboard.html) page for more details.

CloudWatch dashboards provide visualizations for the various metrics that are being monitored. You can have widgets displaying line graphs, numbers, gauges, and [even custom widgets powered by AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_custom_widget_dashboard.html). CloudWatch dashboards truly offer a huge amount of functionality and flexibility. This [CloudWatch Dashboard AWS workshop](https://mng.workshop.aws/operations-2022/detect/cwdashboard.html) is a great place to get started.

## 2\. Which CloudWatch metrics should you monitor?

This is a complicated question. The simple answer is âmonitor everything.â However, while the data scientist in me would love that, itâs not very practical. Monitoring everything comes with costs, in time, money, and complexity. It would be fun, but alas, just isnât worth it.

Instead, set up your monitoring to help you understand the dynamics of your AWS deployment. In other words, make it your guiding principle to monitor _how_ things are failing, not just for failure state itself.

As an example, the `StatusCheckFailed` metric of an EC2 instance tells you about the reachability of system checks. The `StatusCheckFailed` metric is binary, either true or false. If itâs true, it means that the instance is nonresponsive. Any workloads served by this instance will fail. This is monitoring a failure state.

To monitor a dynamic that can show if an EC2 instance may be _heading towards_ failure, look at `CPUUtilization`, `MemoryUtilization`, `DiskSpaceUtilization`, `DiskReadOperations`, `DiskWriteOperations`, etc. These sorts of metrics indicate that a machine may be extremely busy. Combined with a CloudWatch alarm that reports when these metrics are past expected thresholds for an extended period of time, this can serve as an early warning system that an instance is nearing failure. Additionally, by analyzing this data over time, you will learn _how_ the machines are failing and can put the right remediation measures into place.

## 3\. Introducing the CloudWatch Agent

The [CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html) (CW Agent) is a small program that runs on EC2 instances that can report on more detailed metrics. In addition to EC2 instances, the CW agent can also monitor on-prem servers. This enables you to have a consistent set of metrics across all your infrastructure, even in a hybrid deployment. The agent can run on both Linux and Windows.

The metrics that the agent collects are considered âcustom metricsâ and are not part of the free tier. Metrics collected by the agent include detailed CPU information ( `cpu_time_active`, `cpu_time_system`, etc.), disk usage information ( `diskio_reads`, `disio_writes`, etc.), memory usage information ( `mem_active`, `mem_available_percent`, etc.), network, process, and swap space usage information. The full list of CloudWatch agent metrics is available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html).

At CloudFix, we use custom metrics provided by the CW agent to monitor EC2 instance performance, especially after an EC2 instance retyping or [resizing](https://cloudfix.com/blog/cut-costs-right-sizing-aws-ec2-instances/) operation.

## 4\. How to install the CloudWatch Agent

As mentioned above, the CloudWatch agent is available on both Linux and Windows. Letâs look at how to install the agent on both platforms.

### 4.1 Installing the CloudWatch Agent on Linux

If you are using Amazon Linux, the CloudWatch Agent is available as a package.

Amazon Linux 2:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent
```

Copy

Amazon Linux 1:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
```

Copy

Debian-based Linux Distributions:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/ubuntu/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
sudo dpkg -i -E ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c
```

Copy

In production, you want to either bake this into your own [custom AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.customenv.html) or use a [user data script](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html), which can run commands on a Linux instance when it launches.

### 4.2 Installing the CloudWatch Agent on Windows

Download the installer from this URL:

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/windows/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.msi](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/windows/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.msi)

Double click and proceed through the steps of the installation wizard. The default installation location is `C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent`.

## 5\. How to configure and start the CloudWatch Agent

### 5.1 Configuring and starting the CloudWatch agent on Linux

To configure the CloudWatch agent, you need to create a configuration file. This file configures the agent itself, along with the metrics it collects and the logs that are published to the CloudWatch Logs service. You can either [manually create the configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.html) file in JSON or TOML format or use the configuration wizard:

```bash
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
```

Copy

Answer the prompts in the wizard, and it will generate the configuration file: `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json`.

```bash
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json
```

Copy

The CloudWatch agent is now installed and running on your Amazon Linux instance. It will collect metrics and logs based on the configuration you provided and send them to CloudWatch. Check the `cloud-init-output.log` file to make sure that the agent is running:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

Copy

Once you have gone through these steps, make sure that the CW agent will start again if the machine reboots:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable amazon-cloudwatch-agent.service
```

Copy

### 5.2 Configuring and starting the CloudWatch agent on Windows

On Windows, after you have installed the CloudWatch Agent, you can use the configuration wizard or create the configuration file manually. To start the wizard, launch the `amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard.exe` program. By default itâs located in the `C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent` directory.

To create or edit the config file manually, use a text editor. The file is located at `C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\config.json`.

Once you have configured CloudWatch Agent to your liking, open up a command prompt with administrative rights, and use the following command to configure the agent as a service, so it will start when the instance reboots:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1" -a install
```

Copy

### 6\. Validating VPC DNS for CloudWatch and SSM agents

For CloudWatch and SSM agents to work properly, they need to send the data they record to the CloudWatch / Systems Manager services. That means that there must be a network route between the monitored instance and the CloudWatch service, so DNS needs to be functioning correctly. Within a VPC, itâs easy to disable DNS, so itâs important to double check that DNS is enabled. Doing so is a two-step process:

1. Gather the list of VPCs with active EC2 instances in your organization
2. For each VPC, make sure that `enableDnsSupport` and `enableDnsHostnames` are enabled

Letâs dig in.

The easiest way to identify VPCs with active EC2 instances is to use the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR). With a CUR query, you can list the accounts with active EC2 instances:

```sql
SELECT
        line_item_usage_account_id AS account_id
      , product_region AS region
FROM  <YOUR CUR DB>.<YOUR CUR TABLE>
WHERE line_item_usage_start_date
       BETWEEN date_trunc('week', current_date - interval '8' day)
       AND date_trunc('week', current_date - interval '1' day)
AND line_item_line_item_type = 'Usage'
AND line_item_product_code = 'AmazonEC2'
AND line_item_resource_id LIKE 'i-%'
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

Copy

The output of this query would look like:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **account\_id** | **region** |
| 123456789012 | us-east-1 |
| 123456789012 | us-west-1 |
| 234567890123 | us-east-2 |
| 345678901234 | eu-central-1 |

Note that this query is filtering on the `line_item_resource_id` to look for resource identifiers that look like EC2 instance identifiers. However, itâs not returning the IDs of the individual EC2 instances. Instead, itâs returning a list of `account_ids` and `regions` with EC2 instances that have been running within the past seven days.

Once you have the list of `account_ids` and `regions` of interest (or you can take the brute force approach and iterate over all of your accounts and all regions), the next step is to use the `DescribeVpcs` API call to check if the VPC is active.

```python
import boto3

def get_credentials(account_id):
    # Add logic to retrieve AWS credentials for the given account_id
    pass

def describe_vpcs(credentials, region):
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials['aws_access_key_id'],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['aws_secret_access_key'],
        region_name=region
    )

    ec2 = session.client('ec2')
    response = ec2.describe_vpcs()
    return response['Vpcs']

if __name__ == "__main__":
    account_region_list = [\
        ('123456789012', 'us-east-1'),\
        ('234567890123', 'us-west-2'),\
        # Add more account_id and region tuples as needed\
    ]

    for account_id, region in account_region_list:
        credentials = get_credentials(account_id)
        vpcs = describe_vpcs(credentials, region)
        print(f"VPCs for account {account_id} in region {region}:")
        for vpc in vpcs:
            print(f"  - VPC ID: {vpc['VpcId']}, CIDR Block: {vpc['CidrBlock']}")
```

Copy

Each `account_id` has its own set of credentials, so you need to have some mechanism to manage this. The full VPC response object looks like this:

```json
{
  "Vpcs": [\
    {\
      "CidrBlock": "10.0.0.0/16",\
      "VpcId": "vpc-abcdefgh",\
      "State": "available",\
      "InstanceTenancy": "default",\
      "IsDefault": false,\
      "Tags": [\
        {\
          "Key": "Name",\
          "Value": "MyVPC"\
        }\
      ],\
      "DhcpOptionsId": "dopt-12345678",\
      "CidrBlockAssociationSet": [\
        {\
          "AssociationId": "cidr-assoc-ab123456",\
          "CidBlock": "10.0.0.0/16",\
          "CidrBlockState": {\
            "State": "associated"\
          }\
        }\
      ],\
      "OwnerId": "123456789012",\
      "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet": []\
    }\
  ]
}
```

Copy

Look for VPCs with the `State` equal to `available`. Once you have a list of VPCs in an available state, call the `DescribeVpcAttribute` API to check on the `enableDnsSupport` and `enableDnsHostnames` config values. This can be done with the following bit of code:

```python
def describe_vpc_attribute(credentials, region, vpc_id, attribute):
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials['aws_access_key_id'],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['aws_secret_access_key'],
        region_name=region
    )

    ec2 = session.client('ec2')
    response = ec2.describe_vpc_attribute(VpcId=vpc_id, Attribute=attribute)
    return response

dns_support_response = describe_vpc_attribute(credentials, 'us-east-1', vpc_id, 'enableDnsSupport')
print(dns_support_response)

dns_hostnames_response = describe_vpc_attribute(credentials, 'us-east-1', vpc_id, 'enableDnsHostnames')
print(dns_hostnames_response)
```

Copy

The response objects look like:

```json
{
  'VpcId': 'vpc-abcdefgh',
  'EnableDnsSupport': {
      'Value': True
  },
  'ResponseMetadata': {
      'RequestId': '12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678',
      'HTTPStatusCode': 200,
      'HTTPHeaders': {â¦
    },
      'RetryAttempts': 0
  }
}
```

Copy

To enable the desired attributes, you can use this function. It first checks the current status of DNS support using the `describevpcattribute` function. If DNS support is disabled, it enables DNS support using the `modifyvpcattribute`Â method. After that, it checks the status of DNS hostnames and enables DNS hostnames if they are also disabled.

```python
def enable_dns_support_and_hostnames(credentials, region, vpc_id):
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials['aws_access_key_id'],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['aws_secret_access_key'],
        region_name=region
    )

    ec2 = session.client('ec2')

    dns_support_response = describe_vpc_attribute(credentials, region, vpc_id, 'enableDnsSupport')

    if not dns_support_response['EnableDnsSupport']['Value']:
        ec2.modify_vpc_attribute(VpcId=vpc_id, EnableDnsSupport={'Value': True})

        dns_hostnames_response = describe_vpc_attribute(credentials, region, vpc_id, 'enableDnsHostnames')

        if not dns_hostnames_response['EnableDnsHostnames']['Value']:
            ec2.modify_vpc_attribute(VpcId=vpc_id, EnableDnsHostnames={'Value': True})

```

Copy

**Do it with CloudFix:**

You can also ensure that DNS is enabled automatically with CloudFix. The CloudFix `VPC DNS for Agents` finder/fixer runs the same process in just a few clicks. Simply approve the changes and DNS will be configured properly for each VPC that has an active EC2 instance.

### 7\. Validating VPC endpoints for CloudWatch and SSM agents

So, weâve established that CloudWatch and SSM agents need to have access to DNS within the VPC so that these agents can connect to their respective AWS services. In addition to DNS, the agents also require a route from their VPCs to CloudWatch, Systems Manager, and S3. If instances donât have access to these services, they wonât function properly.

To ensure that access, letâs look at how to check, and enable if necessary, VPC endpoints to reach CloudWatch, SSM, and S3. Here are the steps in the process:

1. A CUR query finds (account, region) pairs with active EC2 instances in all accounts and regions
2. We use EC2 APIs to check which instances are running in the (account, region) pairs and identify the VPCs that host these instances
3. For each VPC:
1. Get all subnets
2. Identify private subnets that canât access the internet
3. For subnets identified above:
      1. Check for VPC endpoints for `ssm`, `ec2messages`, `ssmmessages`, `monitoring`, and `s3`
      2. For each missing endpoint from the previous step, find a private subnet that has IP addresses available and create a VPC endpoint

The services, AWS service name, and VPC endpoint type are specified in the following table:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Service** | **AWS Service Name** | **VPC Endpoint Type** |
| SSM | com.amazonaws.<REGION>.ssm | Interface |
| EC2 Messages | com.amazonaws.<REGION>.ec2messages | Interface |
| SSM Messages | com.amazonaws.<REGION>.ssmmessages | Interface |
| Monitoring | com.amazonaws.<REGION>.monitoring | Interface |
| S3 | com.amazonaws.<REGION>.s3 | Gateway |

To get started, we find (account, region) pairs using the CUR query in the previous section. When we have a pair, using the following function to list EC2 instances:

```python
def get_credentials(account_id):
    # Add logic to retrieve AWS credentials for the given account_id
    pass

def get_active_ec2_instances(credentials, region):
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials['aws_access_key_id'],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['aws_secret_access_key'],
        region_name=region
    )

    ec2 = session.resource('ec2')
    instances = ec2.instances.filter(
        Filters=[{'Name': 'instance-state-name', 'Values': ['running']}]
    )

    active_instances = []
    for instance in instances:
        active_instances.append({
            'InstanceID': instance.instance_id,
            'InstanceState': instance.state['Name'],
            'InstanceType': instance.instance_type,
            'Region': region
        })

    return active_instances
```

Copy

This returns a list of instances. For a given set of `instance_ids`, get the VPCs associated with these instance IDs:

```python
def get_ec2_instance_vpcs(credentials, region, instance_ids):
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials['aws_access_key_id'],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['aws_secret_access_key'],
        region_name=region
    )

    ec2 = session.client('ec2')
    response = ec2.describe_instances(InstanceIds=instance_ids)
    reservations = response.get('Reservations', [])

    instance_vpcs = {}
    for reservation in reservations:
        for instance in reservation.get('Instances', []):
            instance_vpcs[instance['InstanceId']] = instance['VpcId']

    return instance_vpcs
```

Copy

This function builds up an `instance_vpcs` dictionary. This data structure has one entry per instance, which makes sense since each EC2 instance can only belong to one VPC. Multiple instances can, however, still belong to the same VPC, so we need to de-duplicate the list of VPCs. Then, for each VPC, we need to check to see which VPCs donât have access to the internet. If the VPCs do have internet access, the agents can use that. Itâs therefore only subnets _without_ internet access that require the VPC endpoints.

Use the following function to check if a given VPC has private subnets without internet access:

```python
def get_subnets_without_internet(credentials, region, vpc_id):
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials['aws_access_key_id'],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['aws_secret_access_key'],
        region_name=region
    )

    ec2 = session.client('ec2')

    subnets_response = ec2.describe_subnets(Filters=[{'Name': 'vpc-id', 'Values': [vpc_id]}])
    subnets = subnets_response['Subnets']

    private_subnets = []

    for subnet in subnets:
        route_table_response = ec2.describe_route_tables(Filters=[{'Name': 'association.subnet-id', 'Values': [subnet['SubnetId']]}])
        route_tables = route_table_response['RouteTables']

        for route_table in route_tables:
            has_internet_route = False
            for route in route_table['Routes']:
                if route['DestinationCidrBlock'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
                    has_internet_route = True

            if not has_internet_route:
                private_subnets.append(subnet['SubnetId'])

    return private_subnets
```

Copy

For private subnets without internet access, we want to check if there are VPC endpoints for the five services ( `ssm`, `ec2messages`, `ssmmessages`, `monitoring`, and `s3`). You can use this function to check a VPC for the list of required endpoints:

```python
def get_missing_vpc_endpoints(credentials, region, vpc_id):
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials['aws_access_key_id'],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['aws_secret_access_key'],
        region_name=region
    )

    ec2 = session.client('ec2')

    endpoints_response = ec2.describe_vpc_endpoints(Filters=[{'Name': 'vpc-id', 'Values': [vpc_id]}])
    existing_endpoints = set(endpoint['ServiceName'] for endpoint in endpoints_response['VpcEndpoints'])

    required_services = [\
        'com.amazonaws.' + region + '.ssm',\
        'com.amazonaws.' + region + '.ec2messages',\
        'com.amazonaws.' + region + '.ssmmessages',\
        'com.amazonaws.' + region + '.monitoring',\
        'com.amazonaws.' + region + '.s3'\
    ]

    missing_endpoints = []
    for service in required_services:
        if service not in existing_endpoints:
            missing_endpoints.append(service)

    return missing_endpoints
```

Copy

Once weâve identified the missing VPC endpoints, we need to identify a private subnet in which to put them. The subnets will need to have available IP addresses, so make sure the code accommodates that. Once you have an identified subnet, you can use this function to create the endpoint:

```python
def create_vpc_endpoint(credentials, region, vpc_id, subnet_id, service_name):
    """
    Note, this function assumes that every service except for a S3 uses a Gateway endpoint.
    This is sufficient for the 5 services needed for CW/SSM agents, but is not generally true.
    """
    session = boto3.Session(
        aws_access_key_id=credentials['aws_access_key_id'],
        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['aws_secret_access_key'],
        region_name=region
    )

    ec2 = session.client('ec2')

    if service_name == 'com.amazonaws.' + region + '.s3':
        response = ec2.create_vpc_endpoint(
            VpcId=vpc_id,
            ServiceName=service_name,
            RouteTableIds=[subnet_id],   # Route table ID should be specified for Gateway endpoints
            VpcEndpointType='Gateway'
        )
    else:
        response = ec2.create_vpc_endpoint(
            VpcId=vpc_id,
            SubnetIds=[subnet_id],
            ServiceName=service_name,
            VpcEndpointType='Interface'
        )

    return response['VpcEndpoint']
```

Copy

To recap, in this section weâve defined the following set of functions:

1. `get_credentials(account_id)`: â returns the AWS credentials for the given accountid (implementation not provided).
2. `describe_vpc_attribute(credentials, region, vpc_id, attribute)`: â retrieves the specified VPC attribute for given VPC ID, credentials, and region.
3. `enable_dns_support_and_hostnames(credentials, region, vpc_id)`: â enables DNS support and DNS hostnames for a given VPC ID, credentials, and region if they are disabled.
4. `get_active_ec2_instances(credentials, region)`: â returns a list of active EC2 instances for a given set of credentials, and region.
5. `get_ec2_instance_vpcs(credentials, region, instance_ids)`: â takes credentials, a region, and a list of EC2 instance IDs, and returns a dictionary with the instance IDs as keys and the corresponding VPC IDs as values.
6. `get_subnets_without_internet(credentials, region, vpc_id)`: â returns a list of subnets within the specified VPC that do not have an outbound route to the internet.
7. `get_missing_vpc_endpoints(credentials, region, vpc_id)`: â takes credentials, a region, and a VPC ID and returns a list of missing VPC endpoints ( `ssm`, `ec2messages`, `ssmmessages`, `monitoring`, `s3`) in the specified VPC.
8. `create_vpc_endpoint(credentials, region, vpc_id, subnet_id, service_name)`: â for specified credentials, region, VPC ID, subnet ID, and service name, create the VPC endpoint. The service names are of the form `com.amazonaws.<REGION>.<SERVICE_NAME>` as given by the table above.

These functions, plus the `(account, region)` pairs returned by the initial CUR query, are the building blocks for ensuring that the CloudWatch and SSM agents have the access they need to the relevant AWS services.

**Do it with CloudFix:**

In CloudFix, the `Fix VPC Endpoints for Agents` finder/fixer implements this process automatically. Simply approve the changes and the VPC endpoints will be created.

VPC endpoints do have an associated cost (which is why itâs important to [eliminate idle ones](https://cloudfix.com/blog/eliminating-idle-vpc-endpoints-achieve-aws-cost-savings/).) However, the benefits from monitoring the instances outweigh the cost of the necessary endpoints. The price of the VPC endpoints is low relative to the savings that you can find with CloudFix specifically and the general savings that you can achieve with the knowledge and insights that the CloudWatch agent provides.

## 8\. Responding to CloudWatch alarms with a Lambda Function

So far, weâve talked about the fundamentals of CloudWatch, which metrics to monitor, how to install and configure the CloudWatch agent, and how to validate the VPC DNS and endpoints to give the CloudWatch agent the access that it needs to run.

Next up, letâs talk about how to react to a CloudWatch alarm. Remember from above that CloudWatch alarms are how we take action based on the inputs of CloudWatch metrics.

CloudWatch can be configured to trigger alarms in response to threshold values on certain statistics. In our Fixer blog on [right-sizing EC2 instances](https://cloudfix.com/blog/cut-costs-right-sizing-aws-ec2-instances/), for instance, we talk about using CloudWatch to monitor memory usage in an instance after weâve changed the instance size. So that we can respond appropriately to the alarm, we need to have a piece of code thatâs hooked up to âlistenâ to the alarm.

We can use this command to set up the CloudWatch alarm:

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
    --alarm-name "HighMemoryUsageAlarm" \
    --alarm-description "Alarm when average memory usage exceeds 98% for 5 minutes" \
    --metric-name "mem_used_percent" \
    --namespace "YOUR_NAMESPACE" \
    --statistic "Average" \
    --period 300 \
    --threshold 98 \
    --comparison-operator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" \
    --evaluation-periods "1" \
    --alarm-actions "arn:aws:sns:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:TOPIC_NAME" \
    --dimensions "Name=InstanceId,Value=YourInstanceId" \
    --unit "Percent"
```

Copy

This code creates an alarm called `HighMemoryUsageAlarm`. The alarm is configured to monitor the `mem_used_percent` metric. It looks at the average value of that metric over a five minute period (specified as a 300 second period in the options). If the average value of `mem_used_percent` is at or above 98% for five minutes, CloudWatch can be configured to send a message to an SNS topic. The details of the SNS topic are set by the âalarm-actions option.

If you arenât familiar with SNS, itâs basically a message bus for AWS services to communicate with each other, like a Slack channel for AWS services. SNS is excellent for âfan outâ style messages, where the communicator can notify many different listeners simultaneously.

Importantly, a [Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/?trk=e0e0d4be-47fe-4336-ab69-7eece7f3d36e&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=%7Bgclid%7D:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!652240143523!e!!g!!lambda%20function!19878797032!147151597893) can be triggered by an SNS message. This allows for the creation of a _feedback loop_. The process becomes:

1. EC2 instance gets monitored by CloudWatch
2. If an EC2 instance is using too much memory, CloudWatch uses SNS to send a message to the HighMemoryUsage SNS topic
3. A Lambda function is triggered by the SNS message
4. The Lambda function increases the memory available to the instance

Hereâs what that looks like visually:

![Diagram: CloudWatch alarm infrastructure](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/CloudWatch-alarm-infrastructure.png)

Figure 1: CloudWatch alarm infrastructure

You can see how this creates a feedback loop. CloudWatch monitors the memory usage and then resizes the instance as appropriate. Of course, this depends on the implementation of `resize_instance.py`. If the load changes on the instance, then CloudWatch can resize it.

Hereâs a CloudFormation template for implementing this infrastructure:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'

                  - ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute
                Resource: '*'
```

Copy

The resources described in this CloudFormation template include:

1. A CloudWatch alarm
2. An SNS topic
3. An SNS subscription, associated with the Lambda
4. A Lambda function, backed by Python
5. A [Lambda permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-permission.html), such that the Lambda can be triggered by the SNS topic
6. A [Lambda execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html), so that the Lambda function can resize the EC2 instance

This CloudFormation template can be deployed by the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy                \
  --stack-name MY-INSTANCE-RESIZE-STACK  \
  --template-file cloudformation.yaml    \
  --parameter-overrides                  \
    InstanceId=i-1234567890abcdef0       \
    S3Bucket=my-bucket                   \
    S3Key=function.zip                   \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Copy

The Python function to resize this instance will have this basic structure:

```python
import json
import boto3

def get_bigger_instance(cur_instance_type):
    # You need to implement this
    pass

def handler(event, context):
    print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))

    if event.get("AlarmName"):
        instance_id = event["Trigger"]["Dimensions"][0]["value"]
        ec2 = boto3.resource("ec2")
        instance = ec2.Instance(instance_id)
        instance_type = instance.instance_type

        new_instance_type = get_bigger_instance(instance_type)

        print(f"Stopping instance {instance_id}...")
        instance.stop()
        instance.wait_until_stopped()

        print(f"Changing the instance type to {new_instance_type}...")
        instance.modify_attribute(InstanceType=new_instance_type)

        print("Starting the instance again...")
        instance.start()

    return "Done"
```

Copy

You can implement `get_bigger_instance(cur_instance_type)` based on your preferences.

As you can see, itâs straightforward to connect a CloudWatch alarm to a Lambda function and have that Lambda function take action. Obviously, monitoring memory usage and resizing instances isnât the only application of this capability. With this basic structure, you can react to any CloudWatch alarm to address a wide range of scenarios.

## 9\. CloudFix â¤s CloudWatch

Here at CloudFix, weâre big fans of CloudWatch. We use data to power our finders and fixers, and CloudWatch is one of the key sources of data about AWS deployments. No matter where you are in your cloud journey, itâs worth taking some time to familiarize yourself with this powerful tool. Itâs easy to get started with the free metrics associated with each service and then expand into custom metrics and dashboards as you get more comfortable.

Hopefully this âstarter packâ has been a useful introduction to CloudWatch. For more information, [read the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/index.html), [watch AWSâs CloudWatch talks](https://www.youtube.com/@amazonwebservices/search?query=cloudwatch), or ask Rahul and Stephen on our [weekly livestream](https://cloudfix.com/livestream/?utm_source=aws-insiders&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=23q2-podcast-promo-livestream).

# ElasticSearch/âOpenSearch to Graviton

## Introduction

> _I have climbed highest mountains_
>
> _I have run through the fields. . ._
>
> _I have run_
>
> _I have crawled_
>
> _I have scaled these city walls. . . ._
>
> _But I still havenât found what Iâm looking for._

> _â U2_

U2âs Bono wrote these lyrics in 1987, long before he had 22 GRAMMYs under his belt. He wasnât yet worth $700 million. Other things yet to come: the weirdness of [Zooropa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEcx9F_FW2U), the misguided decision to [invade our iphones](https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/9/9/6127773/U2-new-album-free-itunes-jokes), and his enormously successful philanthropic efforts with Project RED to fight to end AIDS. We hope, by now, Bono has found what heâs looking for.

But these lines could just have easily been written about engineers combing through heaps of data in the cloud, until very recently. The lyrics change a bit, but the idea is the same:

_I have searched through all the cloud,_

_Sifted through each byte and sound,_

_Only to be let down_

_Only to be let down_

_âCause I still havenât found what Iâm looking for_

Fast forward to 2023, and this problem is largely solved by [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/). Itâs a high performance data searching and visualization platform used for monitoring log files, searching documents, and creating dashboards. Bonus: Itâs incredibly fast, highly performant, and best in class for its use case. Todayâs engineers CAN find what theyâre looking for.

So whatâs the catch? As with many Amazon services, itâs not so much a catch as a must-do configuration. OpenSearch isnât configured to its optimal price vs. performance out of the gate â and there are some steps you should take (like running it on Graviton) that can result in big savings. (Or as U2 themselves said it on 1988âs Desire: âMoney money money money money money, money money.â)

But enough about U2. In this fixer blog, we talk about the increased price-performance which can be achieved with Graviton instances, how to find and update your instances, and of course how to use CloudFix to automate this process.

## OpenSearch and ElasticSearch, a fork in the road

First, letâs clear up some common confusion. This article refers to AWSâ OpenSearch Service. The OpenSearch Service can run either ElasticSearch, or AWSâ fork called OpenSearch. Most of you are familiar with this âfork in the roadâ story, but in case you arenât, hereâs the short version:

[ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/?ultron=B-Stack-Trials-AMER-US-W-Exact&gambit=Stack-Core&blade=adwords-s&hulk=paid&Device=c&thor=elasticsearch) (founded by Elastic.co, not AWS) began in 2010 as a free and open platform for searching and visualizing documents. The core software today is comprised of 3 pieces: **E** lasticSearch, **L** ogstash, and **K** ibana, and this trio is often referred to as the **ELK** stack.

AWS launched a (paid) managed ElasticSearch service in 2015, called Amazon ElasticSearch Service.

Thatâs where the drama heats up: In response, Elastic.co began offering their own paid managed service. This caused a bit of a rift, so Amazon forked the ElasticSearch code, creating [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/).

The article _[Once frenemies, Elastic and AWS are now besties](https://venturebeat.com/business/once-frenemies-elastic-and-aws-are-now-besties/)_ gives a good history. The summary: the AWS OpenSearch Service can run OpenSearch or ElasticSearch up to version 7.10 (the final open source version of ElasticSearch), and AWS and Elastic are now getting along like Bono and the Edge.

Most importantly: the Graviton cost savings fixer we talk about in this article applies to both OpenSearch and ElasticSearch. Read on for supported versions.

## Why Graviton for OpenSearch?

At Aurea CloudFix, we are big fans of the [Graviton family of CPUs](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2-graviton/?trk=3478554f-e06b-44d5-8171-41d0ea80c8c9&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=%7Bgclid%7D:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!544066093413!e!!g!!amazon%20graviton!13344186629!127251221455). These processors were custom designed by AWS to support server workloads in a cost-effective manner. They were [first introduced at re:Invent 2018](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-instances-a1-powered-by-arm-based-aws-graviton-processors/) and are now in their third generation. There are many [new Graviton instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-graviton3-based-general-purpose-m7g-and-memory-optimized-r7g-amazon-ec2-instances/) available for network-intensive and high performance computing. Rather than x86, Graviton processors use the [ARM architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family), which allows for simpler and less expensive microchips.

In fact, the venerable Apple [M1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1) and [M2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2) processors are also using ARM. On a price-performance scale, the Graviton has shown an [average of 40% improvement](https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/2020_0501-CMP_Slide-Deck.pdf) vs comparable x86 instances. And, the great part about ARM/Graviton is that most code which runs on an x86 will run on ARM with little effort.

In AWS parlance, the OpenSearch Service is an AWS Managed Service. Instead of simply giving you access to a blank computational slate, AWS manages the entire software stack for you. They take care of patching, monitoring, hardware updates, etc. In short, they are doing all of the administrative work, and providing you with a functioning OpenSearch / ElasticSearch server, ready for your use.

If Amazon is managing the service, the question then becomes, does the underlying architecture matter? The answer is a firm no. You are paying Amazon to make running OpenSearch their problem, not yours. However, they still give you choice in terms of the underlying instance type and size running your OpenSearch cluster.

Logically, if you are paying for a managed service, you should be striving to get the most for your money, and this means switching OpenSearch to run on the AWS Graviton processor. In the next section, weâll show you why, comparing price and performance of Amazonâs CPU choices for OpenSearch.

## Price and performance Comparison

Letâs start with the money.

Per usual with AWS, comparing all the instance prices is a daunting task since there are so many different combinations of instances to look at. In the following table, we look at large instance sizes, each 2 vCPUâs. The m-series have 8 GiB of memory, and the c-series has 4. Looking at the m series instance, we see that the Intel based m5.large is the most expensive, followed by the AMD-based m6a.large, and finally the Graviton-based m6g.large is cheapest. This pattern also follows with the c-series instances.

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Instance name** | **CPU** | **Price** | **vCPU** | **Memory** | **Storage** | **Network performance** |
| m5.large | Intel Xeon 8000 | $0.096 | 2 | 8 GiB | EBS Only | Up to 10 Gigabit |
| m6a.large | AMD EPYC Gen 3 | $0.086 | 2 | 8 GiB | EBS Only | Up to 12.5 Gigabit |
| m6g.large | AWS Graviton 2 | $0.077 | 2 | 8 GiB | EBS Only | Up to 10 Gigabit |
| c5.large | Intel Xeon Cascade Lake | $0.085 | 2 | 4 GiB | EBS Only | Up to 10 Gigabit |
| c6a.large | AMD EPYC Gen 3 | $0.077 | 2 | 4 GiB | EBS Only | Up to 12.5 Gigabit |
| c6g.large | AWS Graviton 2 | $0.068 | 2 | 4 GiB | EBS Only | Up to 10 Gigabit |

From a performance perspective, comparing CPUs is not quite an apples to apples comparison, but in this case the Graviton is the [Honeycrisp](https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/6/13078268/honeycrisp-apple-explainer-club-apples#:~:text=The%20texture%20of%20a%20Honeycrisp,clarified%20sweetness%20that's%20almost%20frosty.) of the bunch (TLDR: itâs the perfect apple). In more technical, less fruit-flavored terms, Graviton vCPUs have some distinct advantages compared to Intel or AMD vCPUs. Quoting from AWSâ [Optimizing for performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-graviton2-for-isv/optimizing-for-performance.html) document:

_One of the major differences between AWS Graviton2 instance types and other instance types is their vCPU to physical processor core mapping. Every vCPU on a Graviton2 processor is a physical core. This means there is no Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) and more isolation between vCPUs. By contrast, every vCPU on a 5th generation instance type with Intel processor (such as M5, C5, and R5) is a hyper-thread. This means vCPUs share resources and there is less isolation than in the case of Graviton2._

Chalk one up for the Graviton2. Since each vCPU is an actual CPU core, this is an advantage for compute intensive server workloads like OpenSearch.

Narrowing the lens to OpenSearch pricing, youâll see that the same price difference applies.

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Instance name** | **CPU** | **vCPU** | **Memory** | **Storage** | **Price** |
| m5.large.search | Intel Xeon 8000 | 2 | 8 | EBS Only | $0.142 |
| m6g.large.search | AWS Graviton 2 | 2 | 8 | EBS Only | $0.128 |
| c5.large.search | Intel Xeon Cascade Lake | 2 | 4 | EBS Only | $0.125 |
| c6g.large.search | AWS Graviton 2 | 2 | 4 | EBS Only | $0.113 |

In case you still havenât found it, hereâs what youâre looking for: **The Graviton-based instances are 10 percent cheaper than their x86 counterparts**. And, as we discussed above, with Graviton processors you get more physical cores, which means better performance for compute-intensive workloads.

## How to prepare OpenSearch for a Graviton migration

Before you jump into the savings head first, you need to make sure a particular OpenSearch / ElasticSearch domain can be migrated to Graviton. A key term in this discussion is an OpenSearch âdomainâ, which is a logical container for an OpenSearch or ElasticSearch cluster. A cluster contains a collection of nodes, which are individual instances. These nodes hold the search index, and power the search and visualization functionality.

OpenSearch domains are defined by the version of OpenSearch or ElasticSearch that they are running, the storage type and, of course, the instance type powering the cluster. Quoting the OpenSearch Service documentation, here are the supported versions:

_OpenSearch Service currently supports the following OpenSearch versions:_

- _2.5, 2.3, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0_

_OpenSearch Service also supports the following legacy Elasticsearch OSS versions:_

- _7.10, 7.9, 7.8, 7.7, 7.4, 7.1_
- _6.8, 6.7, 6.5, 6.4, 6.3, 6.2, 6.0_
- _5.6, 5.5, 5.3, 5.1_
- _2.3_
- _1.5_

Of all the possible software versions, the AWS Graviton is supported on any version of OpenSearch and versions 7.9 and 7.10 of legacy ElasticSearch. For more details on CPU types and OpenSearch, see the [_Supported Instance Types_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/supported-instance-types.html) document.

All of this talk about versions can be summarized by saying: before we can use the OpenSearch Service with Graviton, we must first make sure the versions are compatible. To migrate an ElasticSearch 6.8 instance to a 7.9 or 7.10 instance, the suggested approach is to:

1. Take a manual snapshot of the 6.x domain
2. Restore the snapshot to a 7.x **test** domain
3. Thoroughly test to make sure there are no issues
4. Restore the snapshot to a 7.x **production** domain

See [Upgrading Amazon OpenSearch Service domains for details.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/rename.html) Note that the 6.x to 7.x upgrade should not be automated as there are breaking changes.

For ElasticSearch versions 7.1, 7.4, 7.7, and 7.8, these can be upgraded to 7.9 or 7.10 using the AWS Management console. The steps are listed in the [Starting an upgrade (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/version-migration.html#starting-upgrades) section of the Amazon OpenSearch Service documentation. As with any upgrade, the most important part is to take a snapshot first as a precautionary measure.

_**Summary:**_ Any version of OpenSearch and versions 7.9 and 7.10 of ElasticSearch can be run on either Intel or AWSâ Graviton processor. Since Graviton is the more cost effective processor and AWS is managing all of the behind-the-scenes complexity, it makes sense to migrate your OpenSearch instances to Graviton.

## How to identify OpenSearch clusters and migrate them to Graviton

The first step in migrating OpenSearch clusters is to find them! We want to find OpenSearch domains for ElasticSearch 7.9 or 7.10, or any OpenSearch domain. To do what, we can use the `list-domain-names` command.

![Using the aws CLI to list OpenSearch domain names](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/opensearch-list-domain-names.png)

For each domain name returned by the result, we want to use the `describe-domain` command to get the `DomainName`, `EngineVersion`, and `InstanceType`.

![Using the aws CLI to describe a particular OpenSearch domain](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/opensearch-describe-domain.png)

Using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), one of the best command line JSON filters, we can combine these commands into a quick bash script.

![Use bash, jq, and the aws cli to list the domain name, engine version, and instance type for all domains](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/script-domain-versions.png)

This script will identify all OpenSearch Service clusters which are compatible with the Graviton. Note that this script will return all clusters, even ones which are _already_ running the Graviton. To identify those which can be converted, you need to filter on the `instance_type`.

Once you have identified the cluster, you can perform the migration. This is done with the `update-domain-config` command.

![Use the aws CLI to update the domain configuration.](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/opensearch-update-domain-config.png)

Once you have issued this command, you can repeatedly check the status until the `InstanceType` matches the one which was specified, in this case the `m6g.large.search` instance.

We recommend that you start by swapping like-for-like instance types, where `$SIZE` describes the different instance sizes, such as `large`, `xlarge`, `2xlarge`, etc.

- `Compute Optimized`

`c5.$SIZE.search â c6g.$SIZE.search`

`c4.$SIZE.search â c6g.$SIZE.search`

- `General Purpose`

`m5.$SIZE.search â m6g.$SIZE.search`

`m4.$SIZE.search â m6g.$SIZE.search`

`m4.$SIZE.search â m6g.$SIZE.search`

- `Memory Optimized`

`r5.$SIZE.search â r6g.$SIZE.search`

`r4.$SIZE.search â r6g.$SIZE.search`

`r3.$SIZE.search â r6g.$SIZE.search`

If you are running a t-series OpenSearch Service cluster, these are very low resource instanceÂ  types which do not have an immediate equivalent in the Graviton family. For these cluster types, it is not prudent to change the instance type to Graviton.

## CloudFix to the rescue!

By now, youâre probably familiar with CloudFix, but itâs always worth a reminder: CloudFix can automate this entire process for you in a few clicks.

For all eligible versions of ElasticSearch and all OpenSearch domains, CloudFix will automatically identify and propose the change of instance type to Graviton. As part of the process, it automatically picks a corresponding instance type from the c-, m-, or r-series of instances, matches instance and cluster sizes, and creates a proposed change. All you need to do: approve the changes.

Any OpenSearch version is eligible, but ElasticSearch below version 7.9 must be upgraded to 7.9 or 7.10 before they can use AWS Graviton. This process of upgrading ElasticSearch versions is the one part of this process that CloudFix canât (and shouldnât) automate for you: there can be breaking changes between versions. Be sure to follow the [Upgrading Amazon OpenSearch Service domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/version-migration.html) closely and youâll be just fine.

Once you have domains which are eligible, CloudFix can transition these to the AWS Graviton. Youâll enjoy at least a 10% price reduction for each cluster which gets migrated to the Graviton, plus [improved performance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/improved-performance-with-aws-graviton2-instances-on-amazon-opensearch-service/). As always, AWS Cost optimization is often about tradeoffs (Bono lyric: It moves in mysterious ways), but in this case it is a win-win: with a migration to AWS Graviton, [itâs a beautiful day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co6WMzDOh1o).

### Transcript

**Carlos Peralta:** Weâre trying to save lives here, right? Weâre not doing online shopping, so we need the data to be completely secure and scalable.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Just a few decades ago, something like this would have been impossible to even conceive of.

**Carlos Peralta:** We learned from day one that we have to think big and think whatâs going to happen in the next 10 years.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Would some of this even be possible if someone tried it on premise?

**Carlos Peralta:** It is just too demanding. It is just obsolete.

**Hilary Doyle:** This is AWS Insiders, an original podcast from CloudFix, bringing you what you need to know about AWS through the people and the companies that know it best. CloudFix is the nonstop automated way to find and fix AWS-recommended savings opportunities. It never stops. Iâm Hilary Doyle. Iâm the co-founder of Wealthie Works Daily.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** And Iâm Rahul Subramaniam. Iâm the founder at CloudFix.

**Hilary Doyle:** Rahul, how do you feel about needles?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Well, not my favorite, but-

**Hilary Doyle:** Fair.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** â¦ if needed, Iâll happily roll up my sleeves.

**Hilary Doyle:** Thatâs great because when you do, it turns out you are also benefiting from the magic of the cloud.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Of course, I mean, everything is connected to AWS these days, isnât it?

**Hilary Doyle:** Isnât it just? Developing new vaccines and therapeutics takes years â¦ experimenting, running trials, designing and building custom facilities that are needed for individual drugs. Then add to this, the data.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** That is a huge challenge, when data that is siloed doesnât lead to collaboration or development of those key insights. Also, the on-premise data centers for supporting scientific workloads and high-performance computing are just notoriously inflexible, even if they do work at times.

**Hilary Doyle:** At times, yeah. So it is no surprise that in the history of vaccine development prior to 2020, the fastest vaccine development ever had taken four years. Now by March of 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, four years sounded like an eternity, but some companies were perfectly positioned to respond to the need because they were already in the cloud. So within months, not years, we heard this news.

News clip: More hopeful news on the COVID-19 vaccine front, Moderna says, âNew study results suggest its shot is more than 94% effective in preventing the virus,â even more promising-

**Hilary Doyle:** The cloud made Moderna possible. And today, we are speaking with Carlos Peralta, director of data engineering and cloud architecture at Moderna. Weâll speak with him about the essential role that AWS played and continues to play in Modernaâs innovative work. But first, because we like tradition, this weekâs AWS news headlines â¦

Iâm pretty sure we need a little mystery music to spin up this first news story. Itâs very Hercule Poirot. Maybe itâs a little more Inspector Gadget? Customers can now search the Amazon Inspector vulnerability intelligence database for details about scanned vulnerabilities. Rahul, solve this news item for us.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Hilary, it wonât tell you where the bodies are buried, but when you turn it on, it will scan all your resources for security vulnerabilities at best practice violations, and it allows you to plug these gaps quickly. So AWS does all the heavy lifting for you. Sometimes though, when it finds a vulnerability, it is so specific and niche that you have to take the time to research how and when that vulnerability is exploited and how that might impact you. This new announcement just makes that task really simple by allowing customers to search the Amazon Inspector database for all of these details.

**Hilary Doyle:** Go Go Gadget news item number two, some AWS AI news now, a family of new instances on SageMaker is now available to help achieve high performance at low cost for generative AI models, including LLMs and vision transformers. Rahul, how practically significant are these upgrades?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Itâs all about AI now, isnât it?

**Hilary Doyle:** Yes.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** AWS just announced two new instance types, the ML Inf2 and the ML Trn1, specifically to handle generative AI workloads. These are instances that have 384 and 512 GB of shared accelerated memory, respectively, just for inferencing. When I look back at some of the conversations weâve had on this show about on-prem versus cloud, I mean, I feel like the excuses for an on-prem setup, especially when youâre innovating and growing, are just disappearing really, really fast.

**Hilary Doyle:** No more excuses. Now onto the football turf â¦ American football, Rahul, sorry. A few days ago, the NFL released its season schedule. Each season, we know that scientifically there are about a quadrillion possible schedule combinations considering primetime TV slots, travel, stadium availability, and obviously rivalries. We are looking at over 26,000 specific factors that need to be considered. AWS has a hand in helping the NFL do this. Rahul, lay out the play.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Thatâs absolutely right. The NFL uses AWS to run high-performance computing workloads, and that means they can figure out the best possible schedule for the year. Simply put, hereâs how they do it. The NFL uses thousands of instances on an hourly basis to run different schedule scenarios. Thanks to AWS, the NFL can put together and analyze over 100,000 possible schedules, something that wouldâve taken massive amounts of people power to do manually, and then narrow it all down to the one perfect schedule.

**Hilary Doyle:** All we really want from AWS is to help on our fantasy football draft. Anyway, next season, guys, next season â¦ Thatâs it for your AWS news headlines.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Moderna is a platform-based pharmaceutical and tech company. It was born in the cloud. It leveraged the platforms for both AWS and mRNA to grow, scale, compete, and eventually outperform incumbents, and it has done this all in a highly regulated environment.

**Hilary Doyle:** Before we talk to Carlos, let me set the scene. Itâs January of 2020 and employees at Moderna start hearing rumors of a virus in Asia that may be spreading to parts of Europe. Now, nobody really knows or understands the extent of the outbreak, but when a worldwide pandemic is declared by the WHO in March, Moderna pivots fast. They immediately decide that everyone will work remotely, and they scale up that work. Back in 2010, the company was actually founded in the cloud, and so working remotely wasnât a challenge. The challenge they did have, the most pressing challenge in the world at the time, was developing a vaccine for this virus.

So Moderna receives the genetic sequence of the virus. It doesnât physically arrive, it is emailed. And 45 days later, theyâve developed an mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. Now, to be clear, there had been years of development that led to this breakthrough. Not only had Moderna been working for a decade on mRNA vaccines, but by going all-in on the cloud, they could redirect instantly to work on a new challenge and then to ramp up the technology needed to address it.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** This was a massive amount of computing to do in such a short period of time, I mean, something that would have been virtually impossible just a short while ago. So letâs find out more about how Moderna leverages AWS to drive their innovation and development. Carlos Peralta is the director of data engineering at Moderna Therapeutics. Thank you so much for being on the show.

**Carlos Peralta:** No, thank you, Hilary, Rahul, for having me. Iâm super excited to talk about this.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Can you paint a picture for us about what the scale of the data and the compute looks like? What was the setup that you had, that you leveraged at AWS, that made all of this possible on your platform?

**Carlos Peralta:** So we developed, in-house, more than 70 apps, custom developed applications, to support different verticals of the company. So we had a bunch of EC2 instances for compute power. Then we migrated to Elastic Container Services, which are a way for us to give high availability. At the time, my manager was very focused on high availability, resilience on the applications that we were building.

So we had, again, more than 70 apps developed in-house, code in the cloud, these being deployed in a high-availability architecture databases for each one of those applications to make sure that we collect the data that we need. And on top of that, all the data that were coming from the clinical trials, which were not ingested by those apps, it was external data providers, right, all the entities that were supporting us on this process?

So we got all that data, and we use S3 because, of course, itâs like simple storage. And it give us the ability to scale that data in S3 with no size constraints or speed constraints. And then the data that was needed to be ingested, we use ETL processes, which is extract, transform, and load, and we put it into our data warehouses.

So centralizing the data from different angles, from the internal applications, from the internal datasets that we collected from designing vaccines, and then the data that we get from the clinical trials and put these on a centralized place where give us the ability to build all these contextualized datasets. So you can paint a picture of a single data point and its life cycle across the board.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Got it.

**Carlos Peralta:** So scalability was one of the biggest things that we got from Amazon because, again, you can scale from two servers to 100 servers with just a couple of clicks. So we were always sure that the things that we were building were able to compute and analyze such large datasets.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So could you just do me one more favor and take this one step further?

**Carlos Peralta:** Okay.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** If you contrasted this with something that, letâs say, somebody in your competition was trying to do on-prem, what would that even look like? Would some of this even be possible if someone tried it on premise?

**Carlos Peralta:** Yeah. It must be a very, very, very tough challenge, because when you say you go to Amazon and you want to spin up an EC2 instance, that is a P from the P3 family, which is super powerful compute, and you need that on prem, youâre going to have to go and buy hardware and then bring it to your office and put it in your server room and then plug it to your network. It is just too demanding. It is just obsolete.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I think it would take 45 days just to do procurement on those GPUs, which are so hard to come by.

**Carlos Peralta:** Exactly. Exactly. And even worse, at the time where supply chain was at its worst, how do you get something? How do you get something like physical? Impossible. So I canât imagine how somebody that lives in still on on-prem systems can do something like this.

**Hilary Doyle:** Iâm just going to break into this interview for a second. Bear with me, because while we are talking about ways in which Moderna collaborated with AWS, I would be remiss not to mention Rahulâs side hustle. Now, you know I donât like competition, but in this case, in this one case, I make an exception, because every week Rahul hosts a livestream with his fellow AWS nerd, the beloved Stephen Barr. The two of them discuss how to use all of the services from AWS to solve hard problems in the easiest way possible.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** And not only that, we also discuss how to do that most efficiently. We break down the latest news from AWS and offer our learnings and insights about them along with some amazing guests from AWS who are both with us in the virtual studio, as well as in the audience.

**Hilary Doyle:** Thatâs right. The livestream is called AWS Made Easy, and you can find out more about it at cloudfix.com/livestream. They stream live, expectedly, at LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitch, theyâre very cool, Facebook. Theyâre keeping Twitter afloat. You can ask your questions live on the show, and this team and their amazing guests will do their very best to answer them all for you.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Okay. Now back to our interview with Carlos, and in fact, back to when Moderna started.

**Hilary Doyle:** Moderna is obviously known as a pharmaceutical company that was born in the cloud, but when Moderna was born, 2010, AWS had only been around for four years. So how and why was this decision made?

**Carlos Peralta:** Thatâs a good question. I was not at the company at that time, to be fairly honest.

**Hilary Doyle:** I know, five years before. You were too young, too young.

**Carlos Peralta:** I would like to think that, yes. But I think that the vision from day one from our leadership was to make sure that we have a platform that can grow and scale exponentially without having to pivot too much into rebuilding and stuff. Of course, Iâm oversimplifying, but thatâs the whole purpose of being in the cloud, that you can scale easily, use the capabilities of the cloud and never be bound to any on-prem systems, when possible.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Got it. So what has this birthed in AWS for Moderna? What has that changed relative to other pharma companies at that time or even today?

**Carlos Peralta:** Yeah, thatâs perfect. Thatâs what I was going to say. Itâs not even at the time. Itâs even today, right?

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah.

**Carlos Peralta:** Because pharma, being a highly regulated space, has always been on-prem systems, physical servers, physical equipment, so you can fulfill the requirements from a heavily regulated environment. So being in the cloud gave us the ability not only to build stuff in the larger scale, but also when priorities change, we were able to just pivot fearlessly and get into that path without affecting what we had before, but reusing all the technology and learnings from the past. So the cloud has enabled us to be faster, more efficient, and aligned with that vision from our leaders to digitize everywhere and be the first biotech that is a digital biotech company.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** That is really interesting. Moderna and general healthcare is, like you said, hugely regulated and requires crazy amounts of compliance. When you guys started with AWS in the cloud, a lot of this compliance itself did not exist across the vast majority of services. So I assume that you guys worked very closely with AWS to get all of these compliances in place, but thatâs some really visionary thinking that I really love, where you made the big bet up front and took the big leap of faith that AWS would work with you to get all this compliance done. What was the thinking? Because that leap of faith doesnât seem to be a common way of thinking across the industry.

**Carlos Peralta:** You are absolutely right, Rahul. We had a super strong partnership with Amazon and everything that we have been able to build and scale in large volumes have been in constant partnership and growing for both companies. We have been able to be part of the design of beta versions of their services that were not only designed for us, but also where we had great input.

So in that partnership, we were able to dictate what we needed, how we needed it, and when we needed it, especially because at Moderna, we struggled from day one because we were not able to find the solutions that we wanted off the shelf. We knew that when we get to the point of clinical trials and those highly regulated last stages of a vaccine, we knew that we had to face those challenges. But at the time when the decision was made, we were not there yet. Right? We were rushing into building stuff that were fully intended to help patients. And we knew that when we get to the point of actually having to file the regulations for the FDA and any other government entities that are required, I think that we were going to be able to accommodate all of that by the time that we get to that point. Itâs just that, for us, everything happened super fast and we changed and grew and became such a big and important company in a very unexpected situation.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I was just going to extend the conversation from compliance and regulation to security, because thatâs one of the other concerns that a lot of highly regulated organizations have about being in the cloud, and a vast majority of these CIOs that I speak to have this notion that they feel much more secure in their own data centers on premise as, again, something thatâs so-called public cloud. So how did you guys tackle that security concern, and how do you go about securing all of your data and all of your infrastructure?

**Carlos Peralta:** Thatâs a good question. Yeah, security has been on our roadmap since day one. We really know in advance with the type of data that weâre dealing with, right?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Right.

**Carlos Peralta:** Weâre not dealing with â¦ I mean, Iâm not saying that not every data point is important, but weâre dealing with data from patients. Weâre dealing data from humans. Weâre trying to save lives here, right?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Right.

**Carlos Peralta:** Weâre not doing online shopping. So we need the data to be completely secure and scalable. So yes, security has been on a top priority since day one. So we manage security in every layer of our architecture from the people who get involved in the conversations from day one, down to who has access to the database. Everything is controlled. Everything follows the standard procedures. Everything is audited and everything is locked. So we have the ability to go back to any point of time and know, what did you run every day at 10:00 AM in the morning? Or why did you run this? What was the dataset you extracted from? How many times did you use any of our visualizations, or how many data points were ingested on any given point of time?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** That sounds like literally a page out of the Well-Architected Framework. That is sage advice for the audience. Since all of you started in 2010 with AWS, that was the early days of the cloud. Right? A lot of the things that we take for granted â¦ I think in 2010, even the AWS Console did not really exist.

**Carlos Peralta:** Itâs true.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** And there was no IM. IM came in 2012. So without all of those pieces in place, Iâm sure that there were tons of lessons you guys learned as you evolved and AWS evolved and you were trying to find solutions to some of these really, really hard problems. What are the lessons that you learned that others can learn from and make an easier decision to move to the cloud?

**Carlos Peralta:** Excellent. Yes, we keep learning lessons today. I mean, if you stop learning lessons, maybe youâre doing something wrong. So weâre still learning every day, and thatâs super cool, honestly, because that motivate us to be better every day.

So I would say that one of the biggest things we have learned is that everything change and everything can change in the blink of an eye. So how are you going to be ready when a change is coming your way? So plan for that. Try to make sure that whatever youâre building, itâs good enough that you can switch and flip and then take an alternative path and still make it work.

We also learned that most of the things become obsolete in technology pretty fast. And working with a such a big partner like Amazon Web Services, we know that every service is evolving also with us. I mean, if we look at Redshift, Redshift, I donât know, six years ago was like, yeah, the data warehouse, but it was-

**Rahul Subramaniam:** It was basically a Postgres database.

**Carlos Peralta:** Exactly. It was like, yeah, itâs okay. And thatâs the offering. But the biggest strides and improving that Amazon made on Redshift in the last two, three years have been amazing. Right?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I agree.

**Carlos Peralta:** We were thinking in times, back in the day â¦ Again, everything changed. And I want to reiterate on that, because technology becomes very obsolete. We were doing ETL processes every four hours, and we were super excited, like, âOh, awesome. Weâre getting data refresh every four hours.â And today, the actual buzzword is no ETL at all, right?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Yep.

**Carlos Peralta:** So how is that youâre going to adopt that new pattern or that new trend, but your systems are not going to be affected? Your end users are not going to be affected? And with Moderna, in particular, we want to always think like, âWhat happens if, in six months, we are 10 times bigger than we are today? What happens in 12 months, we have 10 vaccines in the market? How are we going to deal with it?â So we are trying to always take a step back from every project, analyze the expected outcome, and make sure that we have a plan just to make sure that we are going to be able to accommodate the growth.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Carlos, a lot of the best learning comes from living through some failures.

**Hilary Doyle:** Speak for yourself.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Iâve lived through failures, so I mean, thatâs how Iâve come up. And I share them very generously. But Carlos, Iâd love to get some stories about failures that others can learn from and hopefully make better, more resilient systems. So is there a specific technology failure that you could share that has changed the way you think about any specific AWS service or the way itâs put together or the way you scale it or plan for it?

**Carlos Peralta:** I donât want to give names, just to be fully respectful, but yeah, we chose, in the past, ETL, for example, ETL tools that promised us to do real-time data and configuration to be super simple, so especially because they were born in the cloud, as well, is that what they said. So we chose those tools because they seemed to be okay, but unfortunately six months later, we realized they were really bad. We couldnât accomplish what we were planned for.

So I always go back to the same mindset, but pivot fearlessly and behave like owners. So we accepted the failure. We chose a different tool. Find a better one, and not better because theyâre better than the others, itâs just better because itâs what we need as a business.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Got it.

**Carlos Peralta:** â¦ and disregard what we did in the past, learn how to better assess new technologies and new vendors in that particular line of business of ETLing data, and then move forward with the new tools.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Quick question, was this an AWS tool or a non-AWS tool?

**Carlos Peralta:** It was a non-AWS tool.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Figures.

**Hilary Doyle:** And Carlos, talk about now. Where is Modernaâs focus today?

**Carlos Peralta:** We have 16 different vaccines in the pipeline. So if we talk about data, dataâs going to keep coming. We still are running tons of clinical trials for all our vaccines. That doesnât stop. That doesnât scale down. That doesnât go slow at any point of time. If anything, itâs just increasing.

**Hilary Doyle:** And so you havenât seen a decline in terms of the size of the infrastructure that you are maintaining with AWS?

**Carlos Peralta:** No, no. Actually everything goes â¦ Again, as I said before, itâs just increasing because we are becoming more and more proficient with our data. Weâre getting more data for more clinical trials. Our data scientists are really building new AI/ML models, are going to bring even more impact to all the other vaccines that we have in our pipeline. So data is just increasing.

**Hilary Doyle:** Is there anything youâre still waiting for from AWS?

**Carlos Peralta:** I want to say that I am super on board with one of the latest announcement from Amazon last year in re:Invent with the no ETL. Thatâs their new promise. No, ETL. So Iâm really, really looking forward to it.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Sounds like magic for your world.

**Carlos Peralta:** Exactly. Exactly. That sounds like magic. And again, weâve seen the big improvements they have done. And for my particular line of business, that will be a huge impact. That will bring a huge impact in saving time, people resources, and in getting us closer to what we are really going to. And itâs like real-time data everywhere.

**Hilary Doyle:** Well, Carlos, thank you for your work and for joining us on this podcast. Itâs been great to have you here.

**Carlos Peralta:** No, itâs been a pleasure.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Itâs been an absolute pleasure.

**Carlos Peralta:** Thank you very much. Iâm super excited.

**Hilary Doyle:** It was really interesting to speak with Carlos. I mean, yes, Moderna is more broad than the COVID vaccine alone, but that vaccine story was stunning to watch in real time. I mean, they were a company that had broken from convention, embraced a completely different paradigm in a rigid and extremely highly regulated industry. And then they found themselves in the middle of what was the ultimate proof moment. For AWS, itâs an incredible example of the cloud shaving years off of a tried-and-true process and literally helping to save millions of lives.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I absolutely loved this conversation. Iâm a sucker for stories where technology has such a life-changing impact.

**Hilary Doyle:** Thatâs lovely.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I mean, there were three things I think that stayed with me till the very end. The first was that AWS and the cloud was the key enabler for Moderna moving to a remote setup when COVID hit. I mean, that resonated with me a lot because it was AWS that allowed us to become a completely remote and global organization way back in 2008.

**Hilary Doyle:** Youâre so vanguard.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** The second one is that the kind of innovation that was needed in those dark COVID days could only have happened in the cloud and AWS specifically. Iâm not sure companies could have even come up with these novel approaches had it not been for the cloud, and because this kind of processing is simply not possible in any on-premise setup. And lastly, the icing on the cake was the fact that Moderna believes that AWS and the cloud was literally the only secure and efficient way to go about running a modern, cutting edge and innovative business.

**Hilary Doyle:** Heard everything you said, but now can only think about cake. As always, we want to hear from you. Please send us your feedback. We thrive on criticism. Speaking of which, we speak with someone who is intensely critical of the cloud next time, so stay tuned. In the meantime, you can reach us at podcast@cloudfix.com.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** And if youâre loving the show-

**Hilary Doyle:** Only if youâre loving the show â¦

**Rahul Subramaniam:** â¦ leave us a review. And donât forget to follow the show to get new episodes as soon as theyâre released.

##### CloudFix + Compute Optimizer to Save

# Optimize AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Groups

Stephen Barr

February 5, 2025

![Optimize AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Groups](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/asg-logo.webp)

# Automating AWS Auto Scaling Group Optimization with CloudFix: A Deep Dive

If youâre running workloads on AWS, thereâs a good chance youâre using Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to manage your EC2 instances. While ASGs are great for maintaining application availability, they can also be a source of unnecessary costs if not optimized properly. In this blog post, weâre going to look at how CloudFixâs ASG Finder/Fixer works to automatically identify and implement cost-saving opportunities for your Auto Scaling Groups.

## What are Auto Scaling Groups?

If youâre already managing EC2 instances, you know the challenges of manually adjusting your instance count as demand changes. Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) solve this by automating the process of launching and terminating EC2 instances. Instead of manually creating instances or writing custom scaling scripts, you define a template for your instances and set conditions for when to add or remove capacity.

For example, if youâre currently running a fixed number of t3.large instances for your application, an ASG could automatically launch additional instances when CPU utilization exceeds 70% and terminate them when utilization drops below 30%. This happens automatically, following rules you define, without requiring manual intervention.

Some practical uses of ASGs include:

- Replacing manual instance management with automated scaling rules based on CloudWatch metrics
- Maintaining high availability by automatically distributing instances across your chosen AZs
- Automatically replacing failed instances without waiting for someone to notice and intervene
- Reducing costs by automatically scaling down during off-peak hours

While ASGs simplify EC2 management, their configuration can significantly impact your AWS costs. This is where CloudFix comes in.

## How the ASG Finder/Fixer Works

Like all CloudFix Finder/Fixers, the ASG optimizer follows a methodical approach to identify, validate, and implement AWS-recommended cost savings. Letâs break down each step of the process.

### Step 1: Finding Optimization Opportunities

The process begins with a sophisticated Cost and Usage Report (CUR) query that looks for specific patterns in your AWS usage. Hereâs what weâre looking for:

- EC2 instances associated with Auto Scaling Groups
- Usage patterns over the last 31 days (excluding the most recent day for data accuracy)
- Instances with significant cost impact
- Resources that arenât part of managed services like EMR or EKS

We also apply some smart exclusions to avoid disrupting critical infrastructure:

- CloudFormation-managed resources
- Migration Hub workloads
- Resources tagged withÂ `cloudfix_dont_fix_it`

### Step 2: Cost Analysis

The Finder performs two critical cost calculations:

1. **Standard On-demand Cost (annualized\_public\_cost)**
   - Base EC2 instance pricing without any discounts
   - Projected annual cost based on current usage
2. **True Cost Analysis (annualized\_amortized\_cost)**
   - Accounts for Savings Plans
   - Factors in Reserved Instance usage
   - Includes applicable discounts and credits
   - Considers tax implications

This dual analysis ensures weâre working with accurate numbers when calculating potential savings.

### Step 3: Validation Process

Before recommending any changes, our ValidatorService performs multiple checks to ensure the optimization is both safe and beneficial:

```python
# Pseudo-code representation of validation flow
def validate_asg():
    if not asg_exists():
        return False

    if uses_launch_configuration():
        return False  # Skip legacy launch configurations

    if has_reserved_instance_coverage():
        return False  # Already optimized through RIs

    if instance_age > MAX_AGE_MONTHS:
        return False  # Skip older instances

    if has_warm_pools() or has_overrides():
        return False  # Skip complex configurations

    recommendations = get_compute_optimizer_recommendations()
    return validate_recommendations(recommendations)

```

Copy

### Step 4: Compute Optimizer Integration

CloudFix leverages AWS Compute Optimizerâs recommendations to ensure all suggested changes are backed by AWSâs machine learning-driven analysis. This integration:

- Analyzes instance metrics and usage patterns
- Identifies optimal instance types for your workload
- Calculates potential savings with high confidence
- Ensures performance requirements are maintained

## Benefits of Automated ASG Optimization

1. **Consistent Cost Savings**
   - Automatically implements AWS-recommended instance type changes
   - Typically achieves 10-15% savings on applicable ASGs
   - Zero risk of performance impact due to AWS validation
2. **Zero Operational Overhead**
   - No manual analysis required
   - Automated implementation of changes
   - Built-in safety checks and validations
3. **Continuous Optimization**
   - Regular re-evaluation of ASG configurations
   - Adapts to new instance types and pricing
   - Keeps up with AWSâs latest recommendations

## Getting Started

To start optimizing your Auto Scaling Groups with CloudFix:

1. Click on theÂ **EC2 Resize ASG Instances** button in your CloudFix dashboard![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/gif.gif)
2. Review the automatically generated savings recommendations:

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/resource_tags.png)
3. Click on âCreate Ticketâ![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Create-Ticket-button.gif)

This will use our [JIRA integration](https://cloudfix.com/blog/bringing-cost-optimization-to-your-teams-workflow-with-cloudfix-jira-integration/). Alternatively, depending on how things are configured, you can click âExecuteâ if it is available to trigger the change process.

Remember, CloudFix only implements changes that are:

- Recommended by AWS
- Validated for safety
- Proven to generate savings
- Free from performance impact

Success Story

# CloudFix saves Western Digital $450k on AWS in just 6 weeks

![Western Digital Success Story](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/western-digital-location-header.jpg)

## About Western Digital

Western Digital isnât just the worldâs leading data storage company â they literally invented the hard drive. Today, more than 40% of the worldâs data is stored on its products.

Their mission: to innovate at the boundaries of technology, whether in your pocket, home, car, or the cloud. This innovation is at the core of their culture, whether exploring edge-based solutions in AI and machine learning or creating radical new materials for non-volatile memory.

To invest even more in these innovations, Western Digital relies on AWS technology to accelerate growth while reducing cost. Theyâve realized significant savings through their own initiatives â but with a $100 million dollar cost reduction goal, they were highly motivated to explore additional ways to optimize their AWS investment. Thatâs where CloudFix comes in.

## Starting small (and still saving big on AWS) with CloudFix

Western Digital initially deployed CloudFix in just thirty minutes. âWe started small to see how the product worked,â explained David Sunarta, Sr. Manager, Cloud Computing. âVery quickly, it became clear that our business stakeholders were comfortable with the security, ease, and reliability of CloudFix.â

They started by just accepting one of CloudFixâs savings recommendations â known as âfixersâ â in a single dev account. In their first two weeks, they saved $5k in AWS costs.

Now comfortable with CloudFixâs least-privilege model and AWS-native approach, the team began scaling CloudFix across all their AWS accounts, spanning five different business units. The savings began to snowball, and by week six they had saved an incredible $450,000 â a number they expect will swell to over $1 million within the year.

> CloudFix has exceeded my expectations. Not only have we seen significant savings, we have implemented a repeatable, scalable process that is simple to institutionalize and expand.

âCloudFix has exceeded my expectations,â said Jahid Khandakar, CIO. âNot only have we seen significant savings, we have implemented a repeatable, scalable process that is simple to institutionalize and expand.â

CloudFix saves more than just direct costs, too. By enabling Western Digital to optimize AWS spend quickly and easily â spending just a few minutes of engineering time each week â the company has also dramatically increased the efficiency of their AWS cost optimization practice. Since CloudFix only deploys AWS-recommended fixes, automatically and at-scale, Khandakarâs team can reallocate their limited resources to higher-value, strategic initiatives.

## Western Digital sees more AWS savings in their future

The plan at Western Digital: keep driving even greater AWS savings using CloudFix. That means adopting CloudFix across more instances and deploying the latest fixes as CloudFix releases them. âSimply put,â said Khandakar, âwe are always pursuing better ways to run our business â and CloudFix has helped us do precisely that.â

# 3 Months of CloudFix for Free!? Itâs a celebration!

Earlier this week [we announced that we are offering 3 months of CloudFix for free](https://cloudfix.com/resources/cloudfix-introduces-free-unlimited-savings/). We hope that you get to take advantage of this awesome opportunity! In this post, I wanted to distill some of the questions that we have received and list our answers:

**What are the limitations in place during the 3 month trial?**

None! During the trial, you have access to the full CloudFix suite of Finders/Fixers. It is exactly as if you had a paid subscription, but for free. We want you to use and understand the product, and we are confident that you will see value beyond the 3 month trial.

**Do my savings go away after the 3 month trial is over?**

Not at all. Our Finder/Fixers work by applying remediations such as right-sizing, deleting idle resources, switching managed services to Graviton, etc. Once you have applied the fix, it stays fixed.

**Why not simply apply ALL of the Finder/Fixers during the trial?**

You certainly could apply as many of the Finder/Fixers as you feel comfortable with during the trial. In fact, **we challenge you to see how much savings you can get during the trial!**

**Why are we confident that you will see value after the trial if you can get all of the savings for free?**

Because finding savings is a continuous process. There will always be change occurring in your AWS account, and new features and services are constantly being added to AWS itself. For example, when GPU support was added to AWS Compute Optimizer, within the week we released a Finder/Fixer to optimize GPU-powered instances according to AWSâ own recommendations. The only way to save consistently is with continuous automation. This means that there will always be new ways to save.

**Can I try CloudFix on a single AWS account, rather than an Organization?**

Our blog posts and documentation reference AWS Organizations and âMaster Payer Accounts.â CloudFix is well suited to scanning an entire AWS Organization and deploying the savings across all subaccounts. We understand that deploying on the Master Payer Account may require an extensive amount of coordination, and we are happy to walk you through that process. However, CloudFix is perfectly suited to work on an individual account as well. Be sure to select the âSingle Accountâ option during our simple onboarding process.

**What size accounts is CloudFix suited for?**

We have used CloudFix successfully on AWS Organizations with thousands of subaccounts. With Organizations of this size, CloudFix claws back millions in savings every year! On the smaller side, CloudFix is best suited for accounts that exceed $80K of monthly spend, and utilize multiple AWS services. The free trial is the perfect opportunity to see what you can save. If you are below that size, we still encourage you to give CloudFix a try and see where the savings opportunities exist in your AWS account.

**This seems too good to be true! What is the catch?**

We believe in being transparent! We want you to try CloudFix, love it, see the value, and become a loyal customer. Also, with the free trial you can try CloudFix in a subset of your organization. We are confident that you will see the savings and ease of use, and help make the case for deploying CloudFix across your enterprise. Also, we will ask for your feedback about CloudFix â what you like, what you didnât like, and what we can do better to make CloudFIx the best tool for automated AWS cost optimization.

##### Supercharge Your AWS Cost Optimization with Precision Alerts

# Customizable Email Notifications for CloudFix

Stephen Barr

September 10, 2024

![Customizable Email Notifications for CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cf-email-notif.webp)

Weâre excited to unveil our latest feature enhancement: Customizable Email Notifications, bringing the power of granular filtering directly to your inbox!

## **Hear from Our Experts**

Join CloudFix Chief Evangelist Stephen Barr and CloudFix Customer Champion Bill Gleeson as they give a quick overview of this powerful new feature, as they show you how CloudFixâs Customizable Email Notifications can help ensure AWS resource owners have relevant updates on potential cost savings across their AWS services.

![YouTube player](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jkFrr6xYhkI/hqdefault.jpg)

## **Feature Summary**

- Create custom notifications based on tags, recommendation types, resource types, and more
- Filter alerts by organizational units, AWS accounts, and regions
- Set up targeted weekly alerts for top cost-saving opportunities
- Enjoy the same detailed filtering options as your CloudFix dashboard

## **Why It Matters**

AWS cost management across large organizations is complex, especially when new services or features are added to your infrastructure. Our configurable notifications ensure that our cost optimization recommendations can be surfaced to those in a position to take action on them. For example, you can configurenotifications related to Amazon RDS to go to a central databases team who can apply company-wide policy. CloudFix produces right-sizing recommendations for EC2 instances, and these notifications can be sent directly to the instance owners. If you have application-level tagging, you can send notifications to the application owner or DevOps team.

## **Comparison to** **AWS Budgets** **,** **AWS Billing Alerts** **and Cost Anomaly Detection**

AWS Budgets are for tracking your costs against forecasted spend. They are useful for comparing realized to forecasted and historical spend. [AWS Billing Alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html) are great and we recommend that you set these up. However, by default AWS billing alerts are sent to the account owner. As AWS usage grows within an organization, the account owner often does not directly control the resource. Thus, you will need to configurebilling alerts to be sent to the correct party. And, most importantly, billing alerts simply alert when spend crosses a threshold. This may or may not be actionable, and the user will need to further investiate.

Similarly, [AWS Cost Anomaly Detection](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-anomaly-detection/) can let you know when spend metrics are outside of your standard AWS usage patterns. Similar to billing alerts, this is good information but not necessarily actionable. For example, a spike in usage may cause a cost anomaly, but this may be a good thing, for example a spike in popularity in your application.

## **Key Benefits**

- **Precision**: Receive alerts configured to your specific needs, down to individual tags
- **Efficiency**: Focus on the most critical cost-saving opportunities without constant manual checks
- **Consistency**: Align your email alerts with dashboard preferences
- **Time-** **saving**: Eliminate irrelevant notifications and get information pushed to you
- **Flexibility**: Easily monitor new additions to your infrastructure, like a new OpenSearch layer

## **How It Works**

1. **Tag-Based Filtering**: Use existing tags in your AWS infrastructure to create targeted alerts. For example, tag resources by product name, environment, or owner.
2. **Customizable Alerts**: Set up weekly emails highlighting your top three cost-saving opportunities, filtered by your chosen tags.
3. **Detailed Information**: Each alert includes full information about the resources, potential savings, and current waste.
4. **One-Click Resolution**: Use the âResolveâ link in the email to quickly navigate to the resource in CloudFix and take action by applying the Fixer.
5. **Webhook Integration**: In addition to emails, set up webhooks to send alerts to platforms like Slack for team-wide visibility.

## **Example** **Use Case**

Imagine youâve just added a new OpenSearch functionality to your application. You can:

1. Tag all related resources with a specific identifier (e.g., ânew-opensearch-featureâ)
2. Set up a CloudFix email alert using this tag
3. Receive notifications only about cost-saving opportunities related to this new feature
4. Quickly optimize your new infrastructure without sifting through unrelated alerts

This targeted approach allows you to maintain optimal performance and cost-efficiency, especially for new or changing parts of your infrastructure.

##### Storing Logs Forever? There's a Better Way

# CloudWatch Log Retention Finder/Fixer

Stephen Barr

November 20, 2024

![CloudWatch Log Retention Finder/Fixer](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/intro-image.webp)

Are your AWS CloudWatch logs silently increasing your cloud costs? Like the bulging filing cabinets of offices of a bygone era, CloudWatch logs can grow without bound. Many organizations unknowingly accumulate years of log data, paying for storage they donât need in the process. To fix this, we are excited to ship a new CloudFix Finder/Fixer which addresses this issue. This new feature automatically optimizes CloudWatch Log retention periods, helping you reduce storage costs without compromising operational visibility.

## The Hidden Cost of Unlimited Log Retention

When CloudWatch Log Groups are created without a specified retention period, they store data indefinitely. While comprehensive logging is crucial for operations, storing logs forever is rarely necessary and can lead to significant unnecessary costs. Forever is a long time to pay a recurring cost. And, for AWS customers, itâs a recurring cost that can be avoided. Many organizations have hundreds or even thousands of log groups across their AWS accounts, making this a significant cost optimization opportunity.

Consider this example for an application generating 10GB of logs monthly:

| Month | Log Storage (GB) | Ingestion Cost | Storage Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 10 | $5.00 | $0.30 |
| 2 | 20 | $5.00 | $0.60 |
| 3 | 30 | $5.00 | $0.90 |
| 4 | 40 | $5.00 | $1.20 |
| 5 | 50 | $5.00 | $1.50 |
| 6 | 60 | $5.00 | $1.80 |
| 7 | 70 | $5.00 | $2.10 |
| 8 | 80 | $5.00 | $2.40 |
| 9 | 90 | $5.00 | $2.70 |
| 10 | 100 | $5.00 | $3.00 |
| 11 | 110 | $5.00 | $3.30 |
| 12 | 120 | $5.00 | $3.60 |
| **Total** | **120** | **$60.00** | **$23.40** |

**Annual Cost: $83.40**

Note that this is a simplified example. In practice, the ingestion cost is a function of total data ingested, across all accounts and regions.

This savings may not seem like much, but a mid-sized AWS company may have hundreds of applications generating logs of this size.

> This storage cost adds up month after month, year after year. Any random AWS Lambda function can generate copious log data. And, from personal experience, a simple leftover debug statement can largely inflate the size of the log files. Iâve made this mistake more times than I care to admit! Paying for this /forever/ is just wasteful.

## Introducing Automated Log Retention Management

CloudFixâs new CloudWatch Log Retention Finder/Fixer automatically:

1. Identifies Log Groups without retention policies
2. Implements a 30-day retention period for each log group
3. Maintains compliance while reducing costs

Letâs have a look at the dashboard for this new Finder/Fixer:

![CloudFix CloudWatch log retention dashboard](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/log-retention-dashboard.jpg)

Looking at the dashboard, we can see several assets where the logging cost is in excess of $200 per month, and potential savings in the $100s.

Letâs take a look at one of the details to see the impact of log retention policies.

Click on the details for a particular asset, and you will see a screen like this:

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/log-details-1.png)

See that the annual cost is currently $415.15. This is based on a steady state of 57.46 GB of data ingested per month, and approximately 12 times that amount retained and stored at any given point in time.Â **Important note**:Â [data ingest rates](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/")Â change depend on how much total data is ingested, but at the highest rate is $0.50 per GB. As more data is ingested, the ingestion cost decreases.

Compare this to the 30-day retention policy, where the annual cost drops to $18.41. This is a savings of $396.74 per year, or 95% of the cost. Adding this up across all assets, the potential savings is significant.

In the Details screen, we compute the potential savings based on the current ingestion rate, and 30-, 60-, 90-, 365-day, and indefinite retention periods.

![Log retention details](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/log-retention-details.png)

Notice that in this case, CloudFix is recommending a 30-day retention policy. We recommend fixed policies which are based on heuristics which have been found to be appropriate for most applications. Again, you can always override the recommendation, but we think that the default settings are a good starting point unless you have an external reason (e.g. regulatory requirements) to keep logs for a longer period of time.

## The benefits of CloudFixâs automated approach

Itâs all too easy to forget to configure retention periods when creating new log groups â especially during rapid development or deployments. But donât worry â CloudFix has your back! Our automated solution ensures that, even if you forgot to configure retention periods, the Finder/Fixer will catch the oversight and fix it for you!

## How It Works

Our Finder/Fixer operates with CloudFixâs signature one-click automation, making it an ideal solution for DevOps and/or FinOps teams managing large-scale AWS environments:

1. **Finder Phase**
   - Our Finder scans all log groups in your AWS environment. This includes:
     - RDS clusters and their associated log groups
     - Amazon VPC Flow Logs
     - EC2 Instances ( [if you are running the CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/implementing-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch/configure-cloudwatch-ec2-on-premises.html#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Amazon%20EC2%20doesn,Line%20Interface%20(AWS%20CLI) "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/implementing-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch/configure-cloudwatch-ec2-on-premises.html#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Amazon%20EC2%20doesn,Line%20Interface%20(AWS%20CLI)"))
     - AWS Lambda functions â logging to CloudWatch by default
     - Amazon CloudFront distributions â Access Logs, Error Logs, etc
     - Amazon API Gateway â Access Logs, Error Logs, etc
     - CloudTrail trails
   - The Finder identifies Log Groups without retention settings
   - Analyzes log group storage patterns and usage
   - Calculates potential cost savings and displays in the CloudFix dashboard
2. **Fixer Phase**
   - Creates a change request to set the retention policy to 30 days
   - ### **You review the change request in the CloudFix dashboard and approve!**


     ![Hit execute to start saving](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/steve_execute_gif.gif)

## Important Note

```
If there are functions where you want to keep the logs indefinitely, you can tag them with {"cloudfix:dontFixIt" : true} Â and they will be excluded.
```

## Key Benefits

- **Immediate Cost Reduction**: Automatically remove unnecessary log data
- **Zero Performance Impact**: Changes affect only log retention, not application performance
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All changes tracked through AWS Systems Manager
- **Organization-Wide Implementation**: Apply consistent policies across all accounts

## Getting Started with Automatic Log Group Retention

Implementing optimal log retention policies is now as simple as:

1. Log into your CloudFix dashboard
2. Review identified Log Groups without retention periods
3. Click to approve the automated fix

## Security and Compliance

Like all CloudFix Finder/Fixers, the CloudWatch Log Retention feature:

- Operates through AWS Systems Manager Change Manager
- Provides complete audit trails for each log group modification
- Requires no direct write access to your AWS accounts
- Can be rolled back if needed

# AWS Change Manager: Cost Savings with CloudFix

Dan Hammel

February 3, 2022

![AWS Change Manager: Cost Savings with CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/AWS.png)

For years, theÂ [CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/)Â team has managed and maintained 120+ AWS hosted SaaS products across hundreds of AWS accounts. Although this model follows established AWSÂ [best practices](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/getting-started/best-practices/), the teamâs scope introduced operational challenges. Their team needed a way to identify cost-saving opportunities across their applications without making architectural compromises or introducing service disruption.

# Revolutionizing Cost Optimization with CloudFix

The team responded to the challenge by developingÂ [CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/). CloudFix proved that it could meet their architectural requirements while cutting costs by 10-20%. For example, CloudFix helped with:

- IdentifyingÂ [General Purpose SSD (gp2)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#EBSVolumeTypes_gp2) [Amazon EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/)Â volumes and migrate to EBSÂ [gp3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#gp3-ebs-volume-type)Â volumes with additional IOPS provisioning if necessary.
- Identifying under utilized convertibleÂ [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) [Convertible Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/reserved-instances-types.html)Â and exchange them for a different instance family.
- IdentifyingÂ [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)Â Buckets without lifecycle policies and enableÂ [S3 Intelligent-Tiering](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/intelligent-tiering/).

Here is the story of how CloudFix was built usingÂ [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)Â components and specifically how theÂ [Change Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/change-manager.html)Â capability unlocked key functionality that other tools could not.

## Automated Opportunity Finding

As the CloudFix team explored possible solutions, their first realization was that identifying cost saving opportunities needed to be automated. Although converting all gp2 volumes to gp3 could save up to 20% in costs they had thousands of these volumes spread across their accounts. Each volume needed analysis of past performance to determine if this was the right path or ifÂ [provisioned IOPS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/provisioned-iops/)Â would be necessary to optimize the workload. The data gathering and opportunity identification had to be automated to be feasible due to the scope.

[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/)Â turned out to be a great tool to gather inventory of all of the AWS resources across hundreds of accounts. They enabled Config recording and createdÂ [configuration snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/deliver-snapshot-cli.html)Â in response to configuration updates generated when resources were added, removed, or reconfigured. The snapshots included resource IDs and configuration metadata.

In addition to resource configuration metadata and IDs, usage metrics were necessary to generate quality analysis and recommendations. The team leveraged cross-account functionality inÂ [Amazon CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Cross-Account-Cross-Region.html#enable-cross-account-cross-Region)Â to collect this data.

Once resource configs and metrics were all gathered and stored in a centralized data store, CloudFix ranÂ _finders_Â against the data to create a list of recommended optimization actions.

### Automated Opportunity Fixing

The natural next step after identifying cost-saving opportunities was to execute on the recommendations. It was also important to the operations team to automate this process, because even a simple change needs operational guardrails to make sure that it is implemented in a safe, secure, and repeatable manner.

For example, there are multiple considerations required when converting a gp2 volume to gp3. With each conversion, the team would create an EBS snapshot, create aÂ [snapshot lifecycle policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-lifecycle-management-for-amazon-ebs-snapshots/)Â to make sure that the backup does not accrue unnecessary costs, initiate the volume conversion, and monitor the state of the change. Doing this manually for thousands of recommendations would be both error-prone and tedious.

This realization led the team to developÂ _fixers_Â using customÂ [AWS Systems Manager Automation runbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html). CloudFix published an example of their runbook for converting gp2 to gp3Â [here](https://www.devgraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/EBS-GP2-GP3.yaml).

## Recommendation Workflows

Even with automatedÂ _finders_Â andÂ _fixers_, rolling out changes at scale turned out to be a significant operations workflow challenge. The following requirements had to be considered:

- Account and resource owners needed to be informed of all changes.
- Account and resource owners needed to be able to easily review the AWS Systems Manager document corresponding to the change.
- ForÂ _fixers_Â identified as low-risk, such as converting an EBS volume from gp2 to gp3, operations staff should be able to deploy the change without waiting for approval.
- ForÂ _fixers_Â identified that are higher-risk and require review, theÂ _fixer_Â should only be executed if explicitly approved. Any rejected changes must also be recorded for analysis.
- For all identifiedÂ _fixers_, the operations team needed to keep track of changes performed and monitor their impact.
- Account and resource owners needed to be able to pull up all governance related changes made to their resources.

All of these requirements needed to be met and had to work with tens of thousands of resource changes spread across hundreds of AWS accounts, each with different owners.

### AWS Systems Manager Change Manager to the Rescue

The Change Manager capability wasÂ added to AWS Systems Manager in December 2020. The feature set of Change Manager instantly transformed CloudFix into a scalable cost-savings tool by making the change process streamlined and more secure with the following flow:

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/fig1pd.jpg)

- CloudFix createsÂ [change templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/change-templates-create.html)Â describing each new type ofÂ _finder_/ _fixer_. Account owners have the opportunity to review and approve the templates before any newÂ [change request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/change-requests-create.html)Â can be made in Change Manager.
- For each new set of resources to be fixed, a change request is created. CloudFix itself only has permission to create a change request based on anÂ _approved_Â change template.
- A change request is automatically executed after the account owner or designated approver approves the change. Designated approvers can beÂ [AWS Identity and Access Managemet (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)Â users, roles, orÂ [AWS Single Sign On (SSO)](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/)Â users or groups. The delegates only need permission to approve change requestchange requests and not all of the operations executed during the request.
- Changes that have no performance impact or risk can be auto-approved. The approver still receives notifications when changes are executed.
- CloudFix lets changes be either auto-approved or rejected after a timeout.
- Complex workflows with multiple stages of approval, multiple approvers, or a group of approvers are supported.
- Approved changes can be set to execute at specific times.
- A change request can be tracked and aggregated centrally for analytics and reporting.

## Conclusion

AWS Systems Manager Change Manager provided the features to transform the CloudFix product into a scalable, multi-account, cost-savings tool. It completed their infrastructure-as-code transition by delivering operational changes as pull requests. All of this was achievable by integrating native AWS services.

You can learn more about Change Manager and its available feature set by reviewing theÂ [AWS Systems Manager Change Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/change-manager.html).

[CloudFix is available in the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5wc4rjxznjmwq). With one selection, you can install the AWS CloudFormation templates needed to start getting change requests with cost-reducing recommendations.

# AWS re:Invent wrap up: 4 takeaways from an incredible event

![Stephen Barr](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/stephen-barr_blog.jpg)

Stephen BarrPrincipal Architect and Technical Evangelist

December 15, 2023

![AWS re:Invent wrap up: 4 takeaways from an incredible event](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/AWS-reInvent-2023-Wrap-up.png)

AWS re:Invent 2023 is now officially two weeks behind us, and Iâm almost recovered. If I had to use one word to describe the event, it would be âbusy.â It was an incredible week of information and ideas, people and parties, laughs and livestreams, and of course, lots of walking.

Rahul and I will be breaking down the main themes of this yearâs re:Invent on AWS Made Easy (hint: gen AI) but I also wanted to share my personal highlights.

## 1\. Great keynotes

AWSâs keynote speakers are always interesting and this year proved no different.

[Peter DeSantis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJG6nmR7XxI&pp=ygUbcGV0ZXIgZGVzYW50aXMga2V5bm90ZSAyMDIz) had the Monday night slot, which he has said is an homage to Monday Night Football. Peter discussed the challenges of scaling as more and more services are being engineered to be serverless. Of course, being an AWS keynote, the speech was interwoven with new releases. These included Amazon Aurora Limitless Database, Amazon Time Sync Service, Amazon ElastiCache Serverless, and the addition of AI-powered scaling to Amazon Redshift Serverless.

[Werner Vogelsâ talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTRBVPvzt9w) was the final keynote of re:Invent on Thursday morning. It focused on how cost and sustainability should be design requirements from the very beginning. He announced his framework, the [Frugal Architect](https://thefrugalarchitect.com/), described as a set of âsimple laws for building cost-aware, sustainable, and modern architectures.â In terms of sustainability, it was great to hear him mention that cost and environmental footprint are tightly coupled, as energy cost is one of the key cost drivers behind AWS services. Optimizing for cost often has a positive impact on sustainability and vice versa.

Wernerâs talk was also highly focused on being a builder. With AWSâs investments into AI/ML tooling like BedRock and SageMaker, it has never been easier for an individual or small team to build a robust, AI-powered application. He demonstrated an application he had built using AWS Application Composer and Amazon CDK ML constructs, concluding that âit has never been a better time to be a builder!â

[Ruba Bornoâs keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM2HMK3ufTo) was focused on partner relationships. Like the other re:Invent keynote speakers, the theme of generative AI was woven through her talk. She cited a McKinsey report that claimed that generative AI would contribute $4.4 trillion to the global economy. AWS intends to be a key player in this technology revolution and wants to enable their partners to do the same. She announced a Generative AI Center of Excellence for AWS partners to help educate and train AWS partners on using gen AI. She also announced several new partner services, including the AWS Partner Central software listings, an enhanced AWS Partner Central co-selling experience, the AWS Partner Central Partner Analytics dashboard, and the AWS Marketplace APIs for sellers, just to name a few.

The other keynote that stuck with me was [Swami Sivasubramaniam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8clH7cbnIQw&pp=ygUic3dhbWkgc2l2YXN1YnJhbWFuaWFuIGtleW5vdGUgMjAyMw%3D%3D). Swamiâs keynote focused on the pillars of a data / generative AI strategy. He recommended that this strategy should be (1) Comprehensive, (2) Integrated, and (3) Governed. As part of this framework, Swami spoke about all of the work AWS is doing to make generative AI ready for enterprise usage. The generative AI announcements included Amazon Titan image generation, support for Claude 2.1 and Llama 2 70B in Bedrock, SageMaker HyperPod, and more. As part of the Integrated pillar, support for vector search (which enables AI-based comparisons) was added to many database products: Neptune, OpenSearch, DocumentDB, and DynamoDB among others.

## 2\. Daily AWS Made Easy livestreams

Livestreaming about AWS is one of my professional passions and it was a pleasure to bring our show to re:Invent. Yes, those were some early mornings â we broadcast at 6am every day â but it was a fantastic way to discuss what was going on at the event, talk through the impact of the announcements, and share our insider tips for making the most of re:Invent. You can catch all the episodes [here](https://cloudfix.com/livestream/).

My favorite episode was definitely [the closing party](https://cloudfix.com/livestream/reinvent-2023-closing-party-livestream/). Not only did we stream for an epic almost two hours, we hosted some of the most interesting folks at AWS:

- [Rick Ochs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-ochs-06469833/): Senior Manager at AWS, overseeing Cloud Optimization and a member of the Finops Foundation Technical Advisory Council.
- [Lorenzo Winfrey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzowinfrey/): AWS Senior Specialist in Flexible Computing, with extensive experience in managing large-scale AWS deployments in enterprise and government sectors.
- [Yuriy Prykhodko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuriy-prykhodko/): Principal TAM at AWS, leading Cloud Intelligence Dashboards and an expert in Cloud Native Architectures.
- [Letian Feng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/letianfeng/): Principal Product Manager at AWS, focused on the new [AWS Cost Optimization Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/cost-optimization-hub/).
- [Jeff Barr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbarr/): Vice President & Chief Evangelist at Amazon Web Services.

It was an amazing group of very smart people and we had a blast reflecting on the ups, downs, ins, and outs of the event.

## 3\. Presenting our sessions

I thought our CEO Rahul provided some excellent guidance around AWS cost optimization in his talk, [Saving on AWS? If not, what are you waiting for?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmqFfJrm4Mk) Iâm always partial to presentations that leave you with actionable takeaways and Rahulâs definitely fit that bill.

Itâs hard to top our [Cloud Cost Savings Spectacular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8BNb7ZfuUo), though. [Darko MesaroÅ¡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darko-mesaros/) (AWS Developer Advocate) and I got to flex our acting chops while [Steph Gooch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/awssteph/) (AWS Sr. Optimization Architect, OPTICS) continuously gave us guidance and advice, acting as our friendly AWS Solutions Architect. Rahul played the part of the manager, pushing the project forward and making sure that Darko and I listened to Stephâs sage advice. He then gave the audience a demo of CloudFix, which makes it easy to implement all of AWSâs cost-saving recommendations. Iâve never laughed so much talking about controlling AWS costs.

## 4\. The people factor

AWS is obviously incredible technology, but the thing that makes it so special for me is the people. It was wonderful catching up with the CloudFix team; weâre fully remote and literally spread all over the world, so itâs always a pleasure to come together and spend some quality time. I loved seeing all of our AWS folks in person, especially after our many virtual encounters on AWS Made Easy. It was fun to chat to other vendors as well, explore the expo, and see all the different ways that people are innovating around AWS.

Most of all though, I enjoyed talking to our CloudFix customers and potential customers. Having real conversations about business challenges and successes is so rewarding. Itâs a reminder about why we do this work and a chance to dial into what companies really need and want when it comes to AWS cost optimization.

Thatâs it from me â the four reasons I found this yearâs AWS re:Invent to be perhaps the best event yet. What were your highlights? Let us know every Tuesday on our [AWS Made Easy livestream](https://cloudfix.com/livestream/).

# CloudFix Automates AWS Cost Optimization

Harold Fritts

December 27, 2021

![CloudFix Automates AWS Cost Optimization](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/storage-review-post.jpg)

### Who is CloudFix?

Wouldnât it be great if you could just run a program and save the company thousands of dollars per month in AWS cloud fees? A hero in the offing. StorageReviewâs Brian Beeler attended re:Invent and met up with the fine folks of CloudFix, who have developed an excellent program that helps enterprises save on their AWS fees.

AWS re:Invent has always had a big draw, and with the 2020 event virtualized, the excitement to see what has changed and interact with vendors and other customers was evident on the crowded show floor. Executives typically attend these events, returning to the office with solutions they want to be implemented, but might not have considered the cost.

So cloud administrators have to validate the solutions and ensure minimal impact on the system or process, and the savings are actual. This is a time bandit and not a good use of the adminsâ time. Consulting agencies will audit your environment and make recommendations they believe will benefit your operation, a disruptive and costly undertaking, devouring any long-term cost savings. Ultimately, it is up to the cloud administrator to review existing implementations and recommend ways to cut costs and improve overall performance.

There is good news! CloudFix has developed a program that will run against your current AWS cloud environment and provides you with the tools to help you manage your existing spend and implement new services that will ultimately save you money. Depending on the size of your organization, **CloudFix could save 10 â 20 percent** based on your current deployment.

Born out of necessity, the CloudFix application was developed internally to manage the AWS account with an eye on optimizing the features and programs available and realizing the savings where possible. The result is a secure and straightforward tool that runs automatically, flagging areas that need focus.

Rahul Subramaniam, CEO of CloudFix and Head of Innovation at ESW Capital, explained,

> âWhen exploring internal and third-party solutions, it quickly became apparent that finding cost optimization opportunities was not the problem. The problem was execution. Why? Because the focus was always on big-ticket optimizations that failed to produce promised savings. They were just too complex, too time-consuming, too risky, and ultimately too expensive. No one was looking at the small, simple, risk-free cost optimizations that were tedious to do yet collectively represented significant savings. So we built CloudFix to automate the finding and fixing of these abundant, simple, AWS recommended, risk-free cost optimizations. And it paid off big-time. Weâre excited to now offer it to organizations facing AWS cost challenges.â

### CloudFix AWS Savings: How it Works

Brian coordinated a demo with the developer and executives from CloudFix to see the tool in action and ask questions as they come up. Spoiler alert, this is a genuine product that is simple and secure to implement.

CloudFix is web-based with an intuitive interface that displays all the detail relating to the initial search. This can also be set up to run regularly based on your needs. The tool is proactive, shows potential savings, and lists each line item. This allows the administrator to accept or modify the selection.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/storagereview2.png)CloudFix AWS Recommendations

The security to implement any changes to the current AWS environment is based on IAM user role access. The beauty of this is that you can select and deselect users as needed. The ability for a rogue employee to access the system is minimal because the administrator has the power to disable access through the IAM dashboard.

Cost savings are based on the managerâs template criteria. Before any changes are implemented, CloudFix will ask for an IAM role to allow CloudFix to access the AWS account. CloudFix can run against billing, resources, or both. CloudFix will display potential cost savings and allow changes and modifications before any CloudFix parameter changes are performed.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/storagereview3.png)CloudFix AWS Connection

Once the AWS admin has connected CloudFix, the screen will run through the parameters and make the changes as directed. The display indicates that the tool is running and that savings are pending approval.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/storagereview4.png)

At this point, CloudFix is modifying specific AWS configurations and determining overall cost savings. The savings are displayed at the top of each screen, differentiating between pending savings and savings realized based on the changes applied by CloudFix.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/storagereview5.png)

### Final words

The CloudFix website is chock full of information from whitepapers to eBooks, all intended to arm you with the knowledge to save money and provide the next steps. You can schedule your demo, check pricing, and get recommendations on where to realize cloud cost-cutting.

Bottom line, if your organization has a robust AWS spend, this is a tool absolutely worth investigating. All of CloudFixâs recommendations are entirely based on AWS best practices and recommendations. None of this is rogue tech and while CloudFix canât slash your AWS spend, they can make a material impact on it with very simple to implement changes that could shave off up to 20%.

# Reduce Amazon CloudFront Costs by 65% with Compression

![Reduce Amazon CloudFront Costs by 65% with Compression](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/FIxerBlogImage-2.png)

## Compressing data with CloudFront

Picture this: itâs 1994. Dressed in your favorite flannel, you sit down at the family computer to download a shareware demo of the hottest new game â [Jazz Jackrabbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b16upFloYak), maybe, or Unreal, or Tyrian. The modem makes its signature chirps and beeps as it connects to your ISP. You start the download, then check back in several hours. Itâs almost done. Youâre so close. And thenâ¦ your mom needs to make a phone call. Game over.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/download_dialog.gif)

_[Waiting with bated breath](https://gifer.com/en/7rFB)_

This painful scenario, familiar to many of us of a certain age, demonstrates how compression has been part of daily computer life for decades. Back then, you hoped that the data you were downloading was as compressed as possible, so you could access it sooner with less chance of interruption (thanks a lot, Mom.) Today, the days of waiting hours to download something are behind us, but compression is just as important â especially when it comes to reducing your costs on Amazon CloudFront.

In this fixer blog, weâre going to squeeze (see what we did there) the most value we can out of compressing data with CloudFront. Weâll cover how compression works, when and how to turn it on, and how to enable compression quickly and easily with CloudFix.

## âThereâs no excuse for serving uncompressed HTMLâ: Save 65% or more by enabling automatic compression

CloudFront is Amazonâs content distribution network (CDN). Many AWS-based web applications use it to serve data quickly and efficiently to internet users. CloudFront charges based on âdata egress,â meaning the amount of data transferred from CloudFront to the client.

Since 2015, CloudFront has supported compression. This feature is a game-changer: it can automatically compress many types of files, [reducing data egress costs by 65%](https://quixdb.github.io/squash-benchmark/) (and thatâs a conservative estimate). In fact, [according to Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-gzip-compression-support-for-amazon-cloudfront/), _âFor a typical web page composed of a mix of text, scripts, and images, the overall payload reduction can approach 80%.â_ Weâll take it.

Before we dig into the benefits of compression, letâs review how it works.

![Request and response](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/request-response.png)

In a very simplified client-server model, the client (âEnd Userâ) makes a request and the server (the âOriginâ) responds. In the old days of the internet, the origin was a physical server, either at home, the office, or a colocation facility. As cloud computing grew, the âoriginâ could be an EC2 instance or even an S3 bucket hosting static content.

The setup of this model is straightforward, but if the end user happens to be located far away from the origin, connection latency becomes an issue. Plus, as the number of users grows, all of the requests need to be served by the origin server.

![CloudFront cache miss](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cache_miss.png)

The CloudFront CDN addresses these challenges. Using CloudFront, the client sends the initial request (1). Notice that the end userâs request contains an `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header. This means if the client receives compressed data, it will be able to decompress it. The request is for a file called `new.js`. CloudFront checks to see if it has a cached copy of this file (2), and since it does not, it forwards the request to the origin (3).

The origin responds (4) with the file, but note the lack of a `Content-Encoding` header. This means that the origin is responding with the uncompressed file. CloudFront will (5) compress the file and add it to its cache. It will then (6) respond to the end user, adding a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to let the end user know that the response is compressed with gzip.

The next time a request comes through for `new.js`, the process is a lot simpler and faster.

![Cached request](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cached_request.png)

CloudFront already has a copy of `new.js` and its compressed counterpart, `new.js.gz`. Since the end user has included the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header, it can send back a compressed response and let the client know with the Content-Encoding: gzip response header.

## This is where the cost savings come in

The average âcompression ratioâ for a JavaScript file is 77% â which means compression can yield a 77% reduction in data egress charges. The reduced data transfer time is a nice advantage as well (our 1994 selves would be jealous).

Some folks worry that there is additional overhead on the client side to decompress the file. False! Studies have actually shown that [gzip decompression is orders of magnitude faster than data transfer time](http://henry.precheur.org/web/http_compression). That article concludes by definitively stating:

_Thereâs no excuse for serving uncompressed HTML._

We agree. Compression is a fantastic win-win situation: reduced costs for the hosts and increased performance for the end user.

Quick disclaimer: itâs not quite as simple as enabling CloudFront compression and suddenly saving 77% everywhere, every time. Sometimes compression isnât the right solution. For some file types (mostly ones that are already compressed by nature, like JPG and video) compression doesnât apply. But for text-based files like Javascript, XML, and HTML, itâs an easy win.

## How to enable automatic compression in Amazon CloudFront

So compression is (usually) a very good thing that can significantly reduce your data egress charges and improve transfer speeds. Itâs no wonder that [88% of websites use compression](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-compression#:~:text=Compression%20is%20used%20by%2088.1%25%20of%20all%20the%20websites.) and experts consider it a best practice. Letâs look at how to enable it in your environment.

You can turn CloudFront compression on and off by simply setting `Compress` to `true` in AWS CloudFormation (assuming the distribution is controlled by CloudFormation), or by using the CloudFront API. It can also be done using the AWS Management Console. To do this, open the CloudFront console and toggle the Compress Objects Automatically setting to Yes.

![Edit cache behavior settings](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cache_behavior_settings.png)

For compression to happen, compatible cache policy settings must be in place. The critical settings in the cache policy are:

1. `EnableAcceptEncodingGzip` and `EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli` to `true`
2. Have a TTL (Time to Live) value greater than 0. Time To Live controls how quickly objects in the cache expire. A TTL of zero means that objects are never cached, and CloudFront will not compress them.

Once automatic compression is enabled and a compatible cache policy is set, CloudFront will begin to cache and compress new objects fetched from the origin.

To create a caching policy for a CloudFront distribution, run the following steps:

1. Create a JSON file called cache-policy.json, which has contents similar to the following:

![cache-policy.json](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cache_policy_json.png)Note that we have a MinTTL greater than zero (10 hours in this case), we have enabled Brotli and Gzip compression, and have Compress set to true.

2. Using the AWS CLI, create the cache policy from this JSON file.

![Create cache policy](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/create_cache_policy.png)
3. Update your CloudFront distribution to use the new cache policy. For example, if your distribution ID is E1A2B3C4D5E6F7, you can use the update-distribution command to set the cache policy:

![Update CloudFront](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/update_cloudfront.png)

The ETag is specified to match the most recent version of the CloudFront distribution. You can get the information about the CloudFront distribution, including the ETag, with the following command:

![Get CloudFront distribution and  ETag](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cloudfront_get_etag.png)

Important: CloudFront will only compress files that have `Content-Type` headers that are part of a predetermined list (check out [File types that CloudFront compresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html).) Note that these image types are NOT in the list:

- `image/avif`
- `image/apng`
- `image/gif`
- `image/jpeg`
- `image/png`
- `image/webp`

The only image type that is in the list is `image/svg+xml`. This makes sense, since SVG is an XML-based format and is highly compressible. The other formats are binary and highly compressed. Additionally, there are no `audio/*` or `video/*` types in the list. So donât worry:

you wonât be asking CloudFront to compress binary files. AWS and CloudFront just wonât do it, so donât let those concerns get in the way of enabling automatic compression.

## Even easier: Enable compression with CloudFix

As you can see, unlike some opportunities for AWS cost optimization (looking at you, [EBS Snapshot Archive](https://cloudfix.com/blog/cutting-aws-costs-ebs-volume-snapshot-archiving/)), enabling compression in CloudFront manually is pretty simple.

In this case, the biggest challenge is not the actual process of enabling compression, but identifying when it should be enabled. Many teams find themselves in analysis paralysis, stuck trying to make sure that there are no existing cache policies which would preclude compression â and as a result, not doing it at all.

Good thing thereâs CloudFix. We have automated selection criteria that reduce costs and improve performance quickly and easily. Simply turn on the âCloudFront Turn on Compressionâ fixer and youâre on your way to serious savings.

As usual, weâve built safeguards into the process so thereâs zero risk when running the fixer. To be conservative, CloudFix will only enable compression when:

1. There are no caching or compression policies in place, OR
2. The existing cache policies do not explicitly forbid compressed files.

This ensures that, if it has been explicitly decided to not have caching and/or compression on a particular CloudFront distribution, CloudFix wonât touch it.

There you have it. With automatic compression in Amazon CloudFront, transferring data costs less and goes faster. Your 1994 self would be blown away.

# CloudFix now supports Financial Savings

CloudFix Team

July 2, 2021

![CloudFix now supports Financial Savings](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Generic12.png)

Since the launch of CloudFix cost optimization platform from DevGraph we have seen huge interest and adoption. Today, we are excited to announce that you can save even more with our new financial savings capabilities in addition to resource related savings that are already available.

Letâs start with understanding the different types of savings opportunities available with AWS. Broadly, there are two types of cloud cost savings opportunities.

1. First, you can save by optimizing how you use cloud resources.
2. Second, you can save by managing Financial / Billing aspects such as reserving instances.

CloudFix started with resource optimization and is now expanding to support financial optimization. Our objective is to maximize your cost savings by expanding the number of ways we address cost saving opportunities while still maintaining the ease of an automated scalable self service platform.

When you onboard an AWS account to CloudFix, you can onboard that AWS account as a Billing Account or a Resource Account. Of course, you can onboard an AWS account as both a Resource Account and a Billing Account.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cloudfix-add-aws-account-1-768x473-1.png)

Here is a simple way to think about these two types of Accounts:

- **Resource Accounts:**Â When you onboard an AWS account to CloudFix as a Resource Account, CloudFix finds only resource related cost saving opportunities such as converting gp2 EBS volumes to gp3. These resource related recommendations typically require a technical person (an Engineer or a DevOps person) to make decisions on whether to execute those or not.
- **Billing Accounts:**Â When you onboard an AWS account to CloudFix as a Billing Account, CloudFix finds only billing related cost saving opportunities such as optimizing convertible Reserved Instances. These billing / finance related recommendations typically require a Finance / FinOps person to make decisions on whether to execute those or not.

As a rule of thumb, if you are responsible for Resource / DevOps related decisions for your cloud account â youâll onboard your AWS account as a âResource Accountâ. If you are responsible for Finance / FinOps related decisions for your cloud account â youâll onboard your AWS account as a âBilling Accountâ.

**Optimizing Convertible Reserved Instances (cRIs)**Â is a great Financial cost savings opportunity. With this release, CloudFix now supports cRI optimization on Billing Accounts â if you have cRIs in your AWS account, that is a great place to start saving. CRI Optimization can save up to 50% on your EC2 compute expenses.

It is challenging for AWS users to efficiently allocate their cRI commitments to used resources. CRI Optimizer in CloudFix regularly measures the usage of various instance types, accounts for different discount levels available for different instance families in each region and recommends cost saving actions.

CRI optimizing recommendations follow the same â _recommendation, review, approve, execute_â framework that you are familiar with.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cloudfix-dashboard-1-768x422-1.png)

You can review each of these cRI recommendations before you approve.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cloudfix-recommendation-details-1-768x421-1.png)

Once you approve those recommendations, CloudFix automatically executes those â just like all other recommendations in CloudFix.

We are working on improving the product and on bringing in more savings through a variety of new cost saving recommendations. We are glad you are with us on this exciting journey! We update CloudFix regularly to add new cost saving features. Stay tuned for more updates on how you can save even more with CloudFix.

### Transcript

**Jared Reimer:** The demand for experienced competent cloud talent continues to rise much faster than the supply does.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** The cloud environment is changing so rapidly, that keeping up, in itself, is a mammoth challenge.

**David Brassor:** Where is the value-add of leveraging a third party service provider? And where should I be leveraging my own teams internally, moving forward?

**Hilary Doyle:** So thatâs a great answer, but I also recognize youâre a consultant and that is a very consultancy answer that youâve just given us.

**David Brassor:** Have you been there? Have you done it? Have you got the t-shirt that says youâve done it? The answer, in many cases, is âNo.â

**Hilary Doyle:** This is AWS Insiders, an original podcast from CloudFix, bringing you what you need to know about AWS through the people and the companies that know it best. CloudFix is the nonstop, automated way to find and fix AWS-recommended savings opportunities. It literally never stops. Neither do I. Iâm Hilary Doyle. Iâm the co-founder of Wealthy Works Daily.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I am Rahul Subramaniam. Iâm the founder at CloudFix and a FinOps practitioner and enthusiast.

**Hilary Doyle:** Rahul, they tried to hire AI co-hosts to replace us this season, but no algorithm can nail your comic timing. And frankly, none of them would do my puns. So weâre back.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Yes, we are. Rested and ready to break down all the latest at AWS.

**Hilary Doyle:** I donât know about rested, but listen, the cloud moves fast and we have got to keep up. So season two, weâve got it on lock. Here we go.

Thereâs been a lot of talk about staffing shortages over the last few years. Theyâre manifesting in all kinds of ways. I mean, maybe youâre waiting longer at the grocery store checkout, or your favorite restaurant may be closed a few nights a week because they canât staff the front of house. In healthcare, obviously, this issue has been acute among frontline workers, pharmacists, GPs. No one is immune. Not even, as it turns out, the cloud.

The International Data Corporation, sounds very serious, they predict a global shortage of 4 million full-time developers by 2025. And so for companies moving to, or already in the cloud, there is a very real challenge, some call it a crisis, of finding, training, and then hanging onto your cloud talent.

I mean, didnât we think that moving to the cloud was the hard part? And now it turns out itâs also hard to stay there.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Absolutely right, Hilary. Making the decision to move to the cloud is literally just the first step. The real challenge is when you start executing that move. Staffing your cloud team with the right resources is probably one of the most critical steps right now, and also, possibly, one of the hardest.

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah, they definitely buried the lead in the cloud manual on this one. But anyway, this is an issue that a lot of companies are struggling with. Everyone from small startups, to huge corporations. Iâm wondering if itâs fair to say that the most significant challenge is that the cloud industry is moving so quickly, itâs hard for expertise to catch up to it?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I think youâre spot on with that one. Change is happening on just so many dimensions. AWS services evolve every week, and then new services are created all the time. And also, at the same time, new patterns and best practices are constantly evolving. That just creates a new type of staffing challenge that, to be honest, even Iâm grappling with.

**Hilary Doyle:** Oh my, God. Have we reached your Waterloo? Because I have been waiting for this moment. In fairness, Rahul, this is a challenge that literally no one has completely figured out, and so Iâm glad that you are moderately grappling with it. But just like all business challenges since the dawn of time, itâs going to take some creativity to solve. And so we have gone looking for inspired ideas about cloud staffing and the people who can speak to them. That is all coming up.

But first, Rahul, Iâve never actually heard your cloud computing story. You were a very early adopter. How did you even know what you were looking at

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Hilary, Iâm about to reveal that Iâm really old.

**Hilary Doyle:** I am older than you, so please tread carefully.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So I started with AWS back in 2007, and I donât really think the term cloud was used to describe those handful of API that existed back then. If someone asked you what types of cloud were there, I think the only reasonable answer you would get was the likes of cirrus or nimbus. Am I remembering my clouds right?

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah. Or stratus. You were basically an adopter when the cloud was just a misting?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Basically, right. Anyway, coming back to your original question. When I first started with AWS, like I said, there were just a few API, and this was for EC2 and S3. There wasnât even an AWS console. No IM and then no VPCs.

Even then, I thought AWS was a game changer because, to me, it meant no more data centers or managing those crazy ESX servers.

**Hilary Doyle:** If we could go easy on the letters, weâve got a lot of people listening who speak in words, R.S., but you know what? While we are on the letters, letâs check the mail of the day, by which I mean the AWS news headlines. How is that for a pivot?

AWS has just announced that Amazonâs SageMaker Inference Recommender, or IR, has deeper integration with Amazon CloudWatch for logs and metrics. And, because of a new API, thereâs support for running load tests on existing endpoints. Rahul, you look unusually excited about this IR news. Why is it a big deal?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So Inference Recommender has been around for a little while and it really started easing the burden on developers. But then some customers seem to be very perplexed by why the Inference Recommender was making the decisions that it was making.

Sometimes it would scale up like crazy, sometimes it would scale down like crazy. It was basically a black box. So these latest updates make the recommendations more transparent to the end user, and most importantly, it builds trust in the system.

**Hilary Doyle:** Okay, another AWS improvement thatâs just been announced is all about EBS and AMD processors. EC2, C6A, and M6A instances are going to have much faster EBS volumes. Iâm sorry. I mean, faster is better here, right? Can that just be my impressive tech conclusion?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Thatâs absolutely right. But Iâve really been waiting for this one for quite a while. Letâs just take a quick detour and understand the background behind this one and why this is so important.

**Hilary Doyle:** Thatâd be helpful. Thank you. Yes.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Okay. So Intel and AMD. I mean, rivals, theyâve been going head-to-head for years, and with each generation of processors, we, the customer, look to see whoâs ahead. On top of that, AMD processors have been priced roughly 10% cheaper than the Intel variants, specifically on AWS.

**Hilary Doyle:** Oh, wow.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Now, when Intel and AMD released the fifth generation of AWS instances, or the last generation of chips, AMD was about 10% cheaper, but the Intel chips actually performed better, for most general purpose workloads. So sticking to Intel just made sense. And of course, Intel also happens to be default on the platform. But all that changed with the sixth generation of instances where AMD really started kicking Intelâs backside.

**Hilary Doyle:** Whew.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Just on pure CPU performance. Of course, alongside, you also had these instances being 10% cheaper, right?

Unfortunately, there was this limitation of the AWS Nitro system that caused the IOPS, or the input/output operations, on these attached volumes, which is the storage, which basically caused the throughput to be throttled on the AMD instances.

So even though we have better and cheaper CPUs, customers now needed to make this difficult decision, about whether this IOPS throttling was going to hurt them or not for their workloads.

The vast majority of customers just played it safe and stayed on Intel.

**Hilary Doyle:** Right.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** With this announcement, that decision to move from Intel to AMD just became a no-brainer. Almost all applications should work just as well, if not better, on AMD. And itâs going to cost you 10% less. I mean, itâs a welcome simplification and a win for the customers, who are trying to get more efficient.

**Hilary Doyle:** Okay. Speaking of wins, I know that you are a big World Cup fan, Rahul. Cricket World Cup.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** You got that right.

**Hilary Doyle:** Okay. Well, this next story is about that other World Cup, eTF1. AWS was essential in sharing every kick, every weeping player. This is the most watched sporting event in the world.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** One of the most, Hilary. One of the most. I mean, a single India/Pakistan match ends up having at least a billion viewers.

**Hilary Doyle:** I just want peace with you, my friend. But seriously, youâve got folks watching on smart TVs, on their computers, on their phones and their tablets. That means huge connection and authentication peaks, a number of times a day. There is no room here for low latency.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Absolutely. I mean, leaving the football versus cricket debate aside-

**Hilary Doyle:** Oh, never.

**Rahul Subramaniam:**â¦ And coming to TF1âs challenge. Anyway, way back in 2019, TF1 had to start planning for all of this. Everyone knew when the World Cup was going to be. And this is a story that I find fascinating.

For instance, TF1 one adopted a microservices architecture deployed on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, or EKS. They designed a set of REST and GraphQL API for the front end, and for maximum scalability and event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka. So I wonder why they didnât use Fargate or Lambda. That wouldâve been even neater.

Anyway, they brought in multiple content delivery networks, including Amazon CloudFront, to reliably distribute the video streams to client devices. Thanks to all of that and more, millions of people around the world got to see Kylian MbappÃ© score a hatrick and, unfortunately, not win the World Cup. I was totally cheering for him.

**Hilary Doyle:** Well, the world can be a cold and unjust place, Rahul. Those are your AWS headlines.

Never stop recruiting better talent. That is one of the leadership philosophies of Jared Reimer. Heâs the company founder, president and CTO of Cascadeo. Theyâre based out of Seattle and Manila, Philippines.

Cascadeo is a leading cloud IT transformation services provider and longtime AWS premier tier services partner, but they donât just strive to recruit better talent. Theyâve also taken cloud talent development into their own hands. Launching later this year. Cascadeo University.

Welcome to the show, Jared.

**Jared Reimer:** Thank you very much. Iâm glad to be here.

**Hilary Doyle:** Weâre very happy to have you. I mean, first things first, weâve heard a rumor. Can you explain the connection between hiring cloud talent and fire bubbles on the Mekong River?

**Jared Reimer:** Yeah. So very, very early on, in the formative days at Cascadeo, we were hiring folks locally in Seattle, some of whom weâd worked with before. And I was traveling a lot back then, before I had kids, and was in northern Thailand on the border with Laos. And I was there to see this event that periodically occurs, where thereâs some kind of methane bubbles or something, that spontaneously combust, coming out of the river. And I did not get to see the fireballs, unfortunately, that year. It didnât seem to happen. Unclear why. Maybe itâs just bad luck or maybe the whole thingâs an urban legend.

But I was there and I was sitting on the edge of the river. And I thought maybe thereâs cloud talent elsewhere. And so I put up some ads for talent in India, in the Philippines, and in Thailand. And ended up hiring two of the folks that I met through that process.

**Hilary Doyle:** So no fire bubbles, but thought bubbles instead?

**Jared Reimer:** Exactly. Yeah. And ended up hiring two really amazing engineers that way.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Wow. So Jared, what got you thinking about extending your talent pool globally?

**Jared Reimer:** It wasnât really the cost thing. So if you recall, back then, there was a lot of kind of cost arbitrage with offshoring software development and things like that. But for us, it was really scarcity of talent. And that actually continues to be one of the biggest challenges for us. And thatâs true around the world.

So ignore the inflation and recession and whatever else, the demand for experienced, competent cloud talent continues to rise much faster than the supply does. There are a lot of folks that, maybe they were VMware, IT people, who kind of have tried to rebrand as cloud native or cloud First, but those really arenât the same thing. And so what we were looking for was raw material, and we found it. So young, smart, ambitious, ready to learn. Maybe we donât have to break them of bad habits from the virtualization era, where cloning VMs and moving VM images around was the mechanism.

We really wanted to build our own army of cloud native people. And Iâm really proud to say that weâve done that. And this year weâre launching Cascadeo University, which is our initiative for workforce development.

**Hilary Doyle:** I have some questions about Cascadeo University, specifically because I think we often talk about things that have already happened as obvious solutions, and then we never talk about how they actually happened. I mean, what youâve instituted is sprawling and obviously very effective. Can you tell us about the process of building this training system? Give us a sense of the how.

**Jared Reimer:** Yeah, I mean, I think the key thing for us is great leadership, great mentors, top talent from top computer science programs as raw materials. And then, honestly, AWS has done such a good job with their training and certification. Starting from entry level all the way to the top of their certification hierarchy, itâs really incredibly well done.

And I think that was not an accident. I think they understood, Iâm speculating here, from a very early stage that if they were going to win the long game, building a competent labor force that understood how to use the platform and not just host VMs on it was essential.

So we very closely and meticulously adhere to their training and certification process standards. We encourage folks to take additional certifications and specialties. We pay them the whole time. So theyâre not expected to do this on nights and weekends. We donât take that away from their PTO or expect them to cut into their family time with it.

To us getting those certs, getting that experience learning, thatâs part of the job. Itâs not something you do to get the job. And it never stops.

Like I, myself, keep taking more of these classes. And I just myself retook the Pro Architect exam. Itâs expected that if youâre part of the engineering organization, that youâre always upskilling, youâre always progressing. Thatâs just part of the culture.

And if youâre not, what are you doing? Are you just on vacation the whole time? Thatâs not really the culture here.

**Hilary Doyle:** Okay, thatâs so interesting to me. I mean, what kind of impact does having to run your own talent development factory in-house have on your bottom line?

**Jared Reimer:** Well, I mean, itâs a long play. So if the goal were to optimize for profit, you wouldnât do that, if the goal were to build something sustainable and to do well by doing good and breed loyalty. And in our case, a big part of it is, unlike most of the foreign companies that operate in the Philippines, weâre not there to pull the talent out of the country. We deliberately want to keep the talent in the country. And we do have people in North America, generally people that are client interface, like engagement managers and the senior architects, the leadership, mostly are in continental US, but most of our fulfillment and delivery capability for professional and managed services is done out of the Philippines.

And weâve found thatâs a really great setup. We really like that model, and our clients like it, too, because we can provide resources that are oftentimes much better than what they might find on the local market, if only out of scarcity. Thereâs just not enough cloud talent out there to meet the remarkable increase in demand.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Just taking a step back, what exactly is the skillset that youâre looking for when you talk about cloud talent?

**Jared Reimer:** So the really large global professional services companies had to scale their workforce to hundreds of thousands of people, potentially. And thereâs no way to do that from zero, fast enough.

So what they did, and what most of the folks out there have done, is take experienced IT professionals and try to retrain them to do things that are different than what theyâve done all their career. So if you were a VMware-certified IT operations professional, you were taught a certain methodology for infrastructure, engineering, and operations that is wholly inappropriate in the cloud.

Our approach is totally different. We do not view cloud as a hosting environment. We view it as a platform that you build on top of. And ideally, you build as high up the stack as you can, serverless being the pinnacle, but maximizing the use of platform services and minimizing the use of infrastructure as a service, is the most important concept. And that is really hard to scale because thereâs not enough talent with that specific skillset and experience.

And thatâs really what weâre trying to solve for. How do we train people either mid-career or earlier in their career, maybe as early as intern level, to build on top of cloud platform services and to avoid as much as they humanly can as VM hosting, VM snapshotting, VM cloning, the things that we used to do as the best available option at the time, but which we now know only perpetuate problems, especially from a security and disaster recovery standpoint.

So if you canât provably recreate your infrastructure through automation on zero notice, you fail the fundamental DR BC test. If you can do that through cloud formation, through Terraform, through some deployment automation and configuration management infrastructure as code solution, youâve solved not only your DR BC problem, but a whole slew of other problems along the way.

And so our idea is solve for the hardest part first. And if you do that, you probably get all the other check boxes checked along the way. And in this case, I think the hardest thing is can I provably recreate the running system state, at any moment, with no hesitation and no fear of meaningful data loss or fumbling or whatever else? Thatâs the litmus test, as far as I can tell.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So the folks that youâll be hiring into Cascadeo University, are they primarily computer science college grads, or do you also look for talent from other non-traditional educational backgrounds?

**Jared Reimer:** I think maybe Iâm a little bit biased because I have an academic computer science background. I think for us, understanding how things work and why they work is very important. You can teach people how to pass tests. You can teach people how to do repetitive, manual, kind of labor operations, but thatâs not the same as teaching them to think.

And I think the advantage that, at least for me, the thing that I got out of my computer science background, is a fundamental understanding of why things are the way they are, why they work the way that they do, how they work under the covers. And I place a pretty high value on that, personally. I think thatâs really important.

Some of our people donât have CS degrees, but itâs a pretty important thing, I think, from us from a recruiting standpoint. The other thing is the advanced AWS certifications, like Pro Architect, are so difficult to attain that you canât really memorize your way through it. You can memorize a bunch of facts and figures, but the exams are structured in a way that make it almost impossible to just take the test and pass.

Amazon has consistently insisted on the highest possible bar, and itâs a serious thing. We just went through the MSB audit again, and itâs a massive amount of work. Itâs very intensive. Itâs very in depth and rigorous across a whole range of disciplines, and their technical training and certification is the same. So we really think thatâs a shining strength of AWS.

**Hilary Doyle:** Cascadeo stands out as an innovator in hiring and training. Iâm sure. Jared, youâve looked across the expanse of other companies looking to solve this talent shortage problem. Are there any failures that youâve seen, that come to mind?

**Jared Reimer:** I think the failure is mistaking cloud for hosting. And thatâs very, very, very common. And sometimes itâs intentional because it scales. Itâs a much easier thing to scale VM hosting on a cloud platform, than it is to build .NET native.

But in the end, the only real winner in that is the cloud provider. Itâs certainly not good for the customer. Itâs not good from an InfoSec standpoint. Itâs not good from a DR BC standpoint.

It might be sort of good in the short run, for the professional services or consulting partner, but itâs not good for them in the long run either. Itâs a short-sighted shortcut or Band-Aid to a fundamental scarcity problem. And I understand why much larger consultancies do that. They have to. Theyâre doing it out of necessity. Theyâre not doing it because itâs what they want to do, necessarily.

But if your goal is to have a 100,000, quote/unquote, âAWS experts,â as some have claimed, thereâs no other way to do it. You literally have no alternative but to dumb the problem down as much as you can and simplify it and make it repeatable.

And if youâre trying to build McDonaldâs, then great. But if youâre trying to build a Michelin-starred restaurant, thatâs not how you do it. And of the two, I understand that McDonaldâs is way more lucrative and scalable and repeatable. And McChicken tastes the same everywhere you go in the world.

**Hilary Doyle:** But youâd rather be at the French Laundry?

**Jared Reimer:** Itâs uninspiring. I would much rather do something small and significant and work with really interesting customers.

**Hilary Doyle:** Yeah.

**Jared Reimer:** And I think our engineers appreciate that. Again, weâre weâre not looking to scale like mad. Weâre looking to scale through excellence and through innovation and through competent delivery of cloud native solutions.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Jared, one last question from me. Who, in your opinion, has the upper hand in acquiring top talent right now? Is it the small niche players, who are so differentiated? Or is it the big players who have the brand recognition and deep pockets to kind of go after all this talent?

**Jared Reimer:** I think the right talent, the people that love the game and love the technology, probably are more inclined to be attracted to smaller, more nimble, agile, leading edge, like working with the latest technology, if only because they can move faster. They can do things that the bigger players have to have committees and budget discussions and planning meetings and whatever else about.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Got it.

**Jared Reimer:** We like to be in the middle. Weâre somewhere between the two, and I think thatâs actually not a bad place to be.

**Hilary Doyle:** Itâs a great perspective to go out on. Thanks so much, Jared.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Thank you so much, Jared. This was excellent.

**Jared Reimer:** Absolutely. Thank you for having me. I really appreciate it.

**Hilary Doyle:** Rahul, listening to Jared talk about his struggles to find and train cloud talent, it just sounds like weâre living through an Industrial Revolution.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Yeah.

**Hilary Doyle:** Itâs shifted our work paradigm and entrepreneurs and business owners are going to have to manage their way through a skills gap, while the rest of the world catches up. Weâre going to catch up though, right?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Iâm pretty confident we will, Hilary. I mean, just think back to the First Industrial Revolution. I mean, mechanization was spreading so fast and wide, that talent that was trained for the factory was nearly impossible to find. I mean, it took a while, but what followed, changed everything.

Our entire education system is a product of trying to get a workforce ready to be productive. We now look at our economies in measures of industrial and individual productivity. Iâm quite certain that this cloud-centric revolution, that we are all a part of, is not just going to change how we do things in the future, but itâs already changing our present.

I mean, imagine what the pandemic would have been like if we didnât have all the technologies, and here I mean cloud, that made discovery of medicines possible so quickly. Or on a more mundane note, made remote work and online retail possible, that allowed us to survive through this pandemic. So again, Iâm an optimist. I think we will not just figure it out, but we need to figure it out because it is a global imperative.

**Hilary Doyle:** Before we move on, if you are listening to this podcast thinking, âI could really use a deep dive into the technical weeds of cloud computing,â well, Rahul has been moonlighting.

Thatâs right. He has a live stream with a different co-host. Is that co-host as charming and witty as this co-host? Well, yes. Yes, he is. More so? Probably. But does he have my facility with puns? Absolutely not. Here I have a clear and insurmountable advantage.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Hilary, no one has the facility that you have with puns.

**Hilary Doyle:** Isnât that just the truth?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** And I love you for being my co-host on this show, but I do have another show. Every week, Iâm joined by fellow CloudFixer, Stephen Barr, for a livestream on all things AWS. Itâs called AWS Made Easy and you can find out more about it at CloudFix.com/livestream.

We stream live on LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, as well as Twitter. You can ask your questions live on the show, and we, along with our amazing guests from AWS, will do our best to answer them for you.

**Hilary Doyle:** Well, that sounds both great and also incredibly helpful. Also, who doesnât love Steven? So proceed with the side hustle. Rahul, you have my unwilling blessing. You have my casual blessing.

Joining us now, to talk about big picture, the massive picture, when it comes to hiring cloud talent at huge scale, is David Brassor. Heâs a managing director and partner at Accenture.

David, we are delighted to have you. Letâs start with some background. Accenture launched Cloud First in 2020, with a three-year, $3 billion investment, to enable, accelerate and implement cloud adoption.

The cloud practice was already pretty significant at Accenture. I think it brought in $11 billion in 2019. You are leading the Cloud First design practice. So practically speaking, can you tell us what that means?

**David Brassor:** Sure. So if you think about Cloud First design, what Cloud First design is focused on is think about the tip of the spear for organizations looking at cloud adoption. So everything from their initial cloud strategy, cloud reference architectures, roadmap, thereâs a number of things that weâre seeing across our clients, and one of them being theyâre not seeing the benefits of cloud that they expected.

So in many cases, organizations took, Iâll call it early and fast leaps to cloud. They lifted and shifted existing workloads to cloud, and theyâve now since figured out that theyâre not getting the value from the lift and shift versus the broader cloud transformation opportunities around modernization of legacy workloads, et cetera. But more importantly, tying that back to business value around cloud adoption.

So many of the organizations took a pure technology-oriented approach to cloud adoption early on, and now theyâre finding theyâre not seeing the true business value of that cloud adoption.

**Hilary Doyle:** Thatâs a great segue because weâre looking at the ways in which we hire and structure teams for the cloud. Weâre thinking about ways in which analog can inform cloud. And when it comes to hiring and building out teams, how are you instructing your clients to look at their teams for 2.0?

**David Brassor:** Yeah, a big part of that is re-skilling their existing talent structures.

So one of the things that weâve seen is many of our clients are struggling to go and find that talent, even with a marketplace that is seeing layoffs across some of the major cloud providers, working with a client right now whoâs been working for months and months to hire for a senior cloud resource.

I look at some of my other clients who are, in some cases, looking at having to hire hundreds of people across various cloud capabilities, and theyâre struggling to find the talent in the market.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So David, in the market, we actually see so much noise about not finding the right talent, but could you articulate for us what it means to be skilled for the cloud, in particular? And how does that compare with the skills that they possess today?

**David Brassor:** Yeah, so if you take a look at a lot of organizations, theyâve got people who have had gone and done their cloud certifications. They have some basic understanding of cloud and cloud capability.

And then in many cases, theyâre taunting, âIâve got multiple certifications across multiple cloud providers.â But when you get down to have you been there? Have you done it? Have you got the t-shirt that says youâve done it? The answer, in many cases, is no.

I may have theoretical knowledge, or I may have some initial skillsets and capabilities that Iâve been able to leverage on the cloud, but when you actually look for resources that have lived through large scale cloud migrations, that have lived through cloud ops, that number of skilled resources goes down, exponentially. And thatâs what our clients are looking for now.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So David, in the first wave of these migrations, we were all DIY. Companies and organization took whatever skills they had and whatever resources they had, and they just went and did the stuff. And in the process, they learned.

Whatâs changed now? Because we still have less than 10% of the global workloads in the cloud. And of course, yes, thereâs a huge demand to move there very quickly. But whatâs changed between the first wave and this second wave?

**David Brassor:** So I mean, the first wave was the easy stuff, as Iâve always put it. So this was organizations who looked at simplistic workloads that I could lift and shift into the various cloud providers.

But now, what youâre seeing, is they organizations are tackling the tough things. Theyâre tackling automation. Theyâre tackling containerization of workloads. And now, the skillset requirements have grown exponentially. But in many cases, unfortunately, the talent hasnât, in that people donât have that experience within many of our client organizations.

So thatâs why youâre also seeing them reach out to a lot of the big SIs to say, âHey, how can you come help me? Because my organization just doesnât have the talent base.â

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Yes. And I see this as a big conundrum. On one hand, you have this massive dearth of particular skills, which is cloud technologies. The number of people you have who are truly experienced in migrating complex workloads or even running them in the cloud. Is a finite number. And of course, a limited resource.

Given that thereâs a logical argument to be made that you would take the existing resources you have and train them as fast as you possibly could, to get them skilled in this new technology, for which there just seems to be infinite demand, why then are we seeing massive layoffs? Especially in engineering when they could be retrained or reskilled for the cloud? Because well, everyone is either in the cloud or moving to the cloud.

**David Brassor:** So I mean, itâs an interesting comment, in that one of the dynamics that weâre seeing is that theyâre actually not spending a lot of time on the market. They are, in fact, being snapped up by other organizations. And in many cases itâs organizations that are going through their cloud journeys and looking for that talent.

And weâre seeing some of the SIs snapping up some of that talent also.

And for a lot of these organizations, itâs incredibly important that they start to think about how do they actually retool their existing people.

**Hilary Doyle:** Iâm assuming that youâre working with large and small companies at this point, David. Can you give us an example of someone who has done this well? Surprised even you?

**David Brassor:** If I take a look at some, one organization that weâve been working with, they were very early adopters to cloud, but they retooled their existing organization. They leveraged SIs, to accelerate their journey to cloud, and made sure that there was a proper knowledge transfer program in place. So their team eventually was brought along for the journey.

So as they built skillset and as they built competency, they will then transition some of those next steps of their cloud journey to their own internal teams.

But they were also, along the way, recognizing whereâs the value-add of leveraging a third party service provider, and where should I be leveraging my own teams internally, moving forward?

So making that decision around what skill sets and capabilities do I need to bring in externally versus what things do I want to build on internally, for the long-term success of the organization?

**Hilary Doyle:** So thatâs a great answer, but I also recognize youâre a consultant, and that is a very consultancy answer that youâve just given us.

So I want to understand, I mean, youâve laid out all of the points, and yes, of course, makes perfect sense, thatâs how you should evolve into the cloud. But what is the timeframe weâre talking about? I mean, that speaks to such foresight, and a lot of companies donât have that foresight because they donât have the T-shirt yet.

**David Brassor:** Right.

**Hilary Doyle:** So help us understand, really practically, how this is happening well and how it is failing spectacularly? Because I know that youâre seeing both sides.

**David Brassor:** Yeah. So I mean, how itâs happening well, is that organizations are taking a bottoms up approach to building cloud skillsets, capability, and competency.

So theyâre setting the foundations appropriately. Theyâre training their people, going out and building the landing zones, integrating with security, doing all the right things from a foundational perspective, building automation, DevOps, DevSecOps, into their strategy early on and Agile, and then building on top of those core competencies and capabilities.

Where weâve seen organizations fail is when they attack cloud, as the old saying goes, willy-nilly, where theyâve got competencies going and programs going on here and programs going on there, and no alignment across those initiatives. And those are the ones that, in some cases, unfortunately, we typically will also see that they run into security issues and risks and scenarios, where thereâs been a breach because somebody made a cloud configuration error that caused the environment to be exposed.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So David, I have a follow-up question on this. From everything that Iâm hearing, it seems like there is a need for foresight planning and, of course, the background to make all the right decisions, as you go down this path. What are those basic skills that they need, even to just get started?

**David Brassor:** Yeah, so even to just get started, if you take a look at where organizations have been successful in this, it is bringing people into the organization who have some experience, whoâve lived through prior cloud adoptions, understand the hurdles and how to address them.

So I take a look at one client that Iâve been working with who is on their cloud 2.0, Iâll call it transformation, and they have surrounded their team and brought external talent in that have experience and have been through this journey and know what things to do around setting up your operating models, your governance structures, workload assessments, et cetera, but then theyâre also bringing their internal people along and building capability there.

**Hilary Doyle:** For any young developers who are listening to this and feeling sad, how would you suggest they focus as they try to enter the workforce?

**David Brassor:** Yeah, I mean, I think cloud native development continues to be a significant requirement for pretty much all of our clients who are now looking at their existing legacy workloads, that maybe legacy code bases like .NET and others, and they want to move those to cloud, so they are continuing to have the need for skillsets out there that can develop in cloud native capabilities across the various cloud providers.

So my perspective is if you are coming at this as an application developer, cloud native should be a significant focus area for you, moving forward, and you will become a valuable asset in the market if you can showcase cloud native capabilities.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Got it. I have asked this one question, which is, if you could hire just one person on your team that is responsible for kicking off cloud transformations, who amongst everyone out there would you pick as your first draft?

**David Brassor:** What Iâm constantly looking for, is people that have lived through complex cloud transformations, have been through not just lifting and shifting existing workloads, but going through application and infrastructure modernization, have gone through containerization, have gone through cybersecurity integration and built fault-redundant solutions in the cloud. So somebody whoâs really got that experience of saying, âHey, I know how to architect for cloud. Iâve done it. I know where the pain points are. I know how to address them.â

And Iâll be honest, that is an incredibly tough skillset to find.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Any specific name comes to mind, amongst all these celebrity rockstar cloud transformers?

**David Brassor:** Iâm not going to name names. Iâm just suggesting it is more of a capability piece.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** For the record, I pick Werner Vogels. If I had him on my team, Iâm all set.

**David Brassor:** Thatâs a really good choice.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So David, it looks like if I just look at the entire resource pool out there, weâve traditionally had very few women in tech, but it feels like the cloud is one of those paradigms which levels the playing field.

Everyone is rushed at the beginning, it seems. Everyone is learning. Everyone is trying to figure out how to make it work. How are you seeing that transformation play out, when you look at the resource pool, especially when it comes to gender equality and the cloud?

**David Brassor:** Yeah, I mean, I think cloud has been the great leveler of the playing field in that aspect, in that, as you said, there is such demand for the skillsets out there. So we are actively seeing, we go into many of our clients and in some cases itâs a 50/50 mix of female and male talent within a number of their cloud environments.

So youâre seeing a number of female tech executives, female tech senior leaders, playing senior leadership roles across many organizations. So a great example, one client Iâm working for, their SVP that has responsibility for all of their IT and operations is a female resource. And weâre seeing that across so many of our clients that, ultimately, the cloud has really been a leveling of the playing field for female talent in that it has allowed so many people to jump into senior leadership roles.

And I think across so many of my clients as well as some of the software partners that I work with, I get on calls and in many cases, and a great example, I was on one yesterday, where there was more female cloud talent on that call than there was male.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** What is the one piece of advice that you have for organizations that are charting out this cloud journey, from a talent perspective, that they should absolutely not do?

**David Brassor:** I think what they should not do is, I guess, is sit on their laurels and assume that Iâve got some people that are helping me with my cloud migration and cloud transformation. They need to continue to look at the marketplace and look for new skillsets and capabilities as their capabilities evolve.

In many cases, as I said earlier, so many of the cloud people within many of our client organizations are carrying and wearing multiple hats. They may be doing cloud ops. They may be doing architecture. They may be doing security. And as you grow, thatâs not a sustainable model anymore. I need to build specific competencies and capabilities. And so a great example with one client, we had a client who had a major breach, a number of years ago, and they attributed it back to the fact that they had a very small cloud team that was so diverse and was wearing so many hats, that they started to not have enough depth and experience to be able to ensure they were properly securing and controlling their environment.

And ultimately, that was what they determined, that led to a breach within their environment, was not having that, enough people with the right level of depth and expertise, to make sure that they werenât going to end up on the front page of the press because of a breach.

**Hilary Doyle:** David Brassor, thank you so much for your time. Thank you.

**David Brassor:** Thank you.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** It was a pleasure having you, David. Thank you so much.

**David Brassor:** Thank you for having me.

**Hilary Doyle:** David Brassor, sharing insights from his extensive experience in the cloud. I wanted the two of you to go head-to-head, but everyone seems to agree on the premise here.

Plus, David is Canadian, so it was bound to be a pleasant conversation. But what are the Subramaniam hot takes to what was just said?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So the conversation really made me even more convinced that expecting to find experienced resources who have mastered cloud patterns is really a foolâs errand. I mean, number one, there is this super tiny pool of resources who would qualify against that bar, and most likely, they already work for one of the cloud service providers.

**Hilary Doyle:** Right.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Second, is that the cloud environment is changing so rapidly that keeping up, in itself, is a mammoth challenge. I mean, this is a continuous game of catch up. And in this particular case, you really need to rethink what it means to hire talent.

**Hilary Doyle:** But what do you mean by rethink talent? I mean, do we have to think differently about when and where we hire talent? Is there any single fix to this problem of finding and leveling up your talent pool?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** So thereâs this two-pronged approach that I would recommend.

The first is that a lot of organizations are looking for the top 1% talent pool, but limiting themselves to a particular geography. If you hired from the top 1% globally, instead, you just have a significantly larger pool to recruit from. I mean, thatâs just how math works.

**Hilary Doyle:** The wrath of the math. I like it.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** And the second is that you might want to augment your talent acquisition strategy with talent development. I mean, this is what we heard Jared talk about today. Training your staff for the skills and tasks you need them to perform seems like the need of the R.

And Iâm hopeful, though, that this would just be a short to medium term Band-Aid. The reality is that thereâs this huge gap in supply and demand of talent, but the way capitalism works is that the wider the gap, the faster it gets filled.

**Hilary Doyle:** Sure. I mean, it doesnât sound like thatâs been the case, to date, but maybe that starts changing now. There were different opinions between Jared and David when it came to re-skilling your current talent. David was saying, sure. And Jared was really saying old dogs, you know the adage. So whatâs your opinion?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** I think I would side with Jared as default because the cloud is a completely different paradigm and needs this hard reset in thinking.

**Hilary Doyle:** Mm-hmm.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** However, if you have high caliber resources that can learn fast and change their mindset about how things are done, I can see re-skilling being a viable option. I think the only advice I can give someone is something that we follow ourselves. First, hire smart people. People who can learn fast.

Second, kickstart your cloud projects quickly and create an environment where folks can experiment, fail, and learn and deliver solutions quickly. I think this really is the fastest way to build a cloud-centric organization.

**Hilary Doyle:** So weâve covered fast, but whatâs the simplest solution to cloud staffing challenges?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Use automation and tools to do everything that humans find mundane or repeatable.

**Hilary Doyle:** Bam. How long until this actually levels out and we catch up? Does that ever happen? Or does this challenge just become more entrenched over time?

**Rahul Subramaniam:** Hilary, as you know, Iâm an optimist.

**Hilary Doyle:** So am I.

**Rahul Subramaniam:** And the reason why Iâm an optimist is because there are two invariants that I know of. The first one is that AWS and the move to the cloud is an imperative for business. Itâs already happening. The second one is that with all the amazing work that AWS is putting into certifications and education, the pool of potential resources that is starting to get hands-on experience is growing at an incredible pace. So the gap in cloud knowledge is really shrinking fast. The bottom line really is that the future definitely looks brighter and better.

**Hilary Doyle:** Okay. Itâs a huge conversation. We want to keep it going. So you can email us at podcast@CloudFix.com. Please send us your thoughts about the show and what youâd like to hear about in future episodes.

## Remove Idle DynamoDB Tables
**Announcing CloudFix AI**: AI-powered step-by-step guidance to implement advanced savings. [Check it out!](https://cloudfix.com/new-cloudfix-ai-chrome-extension/)

â

##### A DynamoDB Finder/Fixer

# Automatically Removing Idle DynamoDB Tables

Stephen Barr

February 12, 2025

![Automatically Removing Idle DynamoDB Tables](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/sweep-up-dynamo.webp)

CloudFix features many different optimizations. Broadly speaking, we have Finder/Fixers which _adjust_, and others which _eliminate_. Examples of _adjusting_ finder/fixers are [Optimize AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Groups](https://cloudfix.com/blog/optimize-auto-scaling-groups/) and [S3 Intelligent Tiering](https://cloudfix.com/blog/aws-s3-intelligent-tiering-default-storage-class/). These Finder/Fixers are typically based on a cost-tradeoff, and CloudFix adds value by doing this calculation and implementing the fix. The _eliminating_ Finder/Fixers get rid of idle resources.

There is something jarring about paying for things you arenât using. Iâm sure Iâm not the only one who has seen something on their credit card and thought âOh shoot! How long have I been paying for _that?_â We canât help you with that Hulu subscription you forgot to cancel, but idle AWS resources can get A LOT more expensive and that is exactly what we can help with.

In this blog post, Iâll talk about the situations where DynamoDB incurs a fixed cost, how we identify idle DynamoDB tables, and our process for deactivating them.

## **What is DynamoDB?**

DynamoDB is AWSâs flagship NoSQL database service, offering consistent single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. However, like many cloud resources, DynamoDB tables can sometimes fall into disuse while continuing to generate costs. This commonly happens during development and testing phases, or when applications are deprecated but their supporting infrastructure remains.

The challenge isnât just identifying these idle tables â itâs also ensuring their safe removal while maintaining proper backups for compliance and recovery purposes. Manual identification and cleanup processes are time-consuming and error-prone, makingÂ automation the ideal solution.

## **DynamoDB Pricing and Options**

DynamoDB pricing two major dimensions: Provisioned vs On-Demand and Standard vs Infrequent Access. Here is an infographic to show where the different scenarios are relevant.

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/dynamo-db-pricing-viz.png)

Provisioned vs On-Demand, Standard vs Infrequent

In us-east-1, as of Feb 2025, the pricing is given in this table:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature** | **Provisioned Capacity** | **On-Demand Capacity** |
| Writes | $0.00065 per WCU per hour (~$0.043 per million writes) | $1.25 per million write request units |
| Reads | $0.00013 per RCU per hour (~$0.043 per million reads) | $0.25 per million read request units |
| Storage | $0.25 per GB per month (Standard) | $0.25 per GB per month (Standard) |

Whether to use Provisioned or On-Demand is the subject of a different article. Provisioned Capacity DynamoDB tables incur an hourly charge, so we certainly do not want to be paying that. However, in either case we are paying for storage at a relative premium â DynamoDB [cold storage](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/archive-to-cold-storage-with-amazon-dynamodb/) is 1/8th the price! If we arenât using the table at all, then letâs not pay for it either way.

## **Identifying Idle Tables: CloudFixâs Smart Finder**

CloudFixâs new DynamoDB idle table detection uses a multi-step approach to make sure that identified tables are indeed idle. First, we use the [AWS Cost and Usage Report](https://cloudfix.com/blog/aws-foundational-skills-cost-and-usage-report-cur/), searching for line items with product code AmazonDynamoDB. This is the most reliable way to find all tables across the organization. Once this is done, our validator makes sure that we only consider:

- Tables that are at least 30 days old
- No significant read or write activity within the configured lookback period
- Minimal consumed read/write capacity units (configurable threshold)
- Tables that arenât tagged with the cloudfix\_dont\_fix\_it tag (our tag for ignoring resources)

This multi-faceted approach ensures that only genuinely idle tables are flagged for removal, preventing any disruption to active workloads.

## **Locking in the Savings: CloudFixâs Smart Fixer**

When an idle table is identified, we put together a runbook for removing the idle table. This runbook goes through the following steps:

- Validates table is in ACTIVE state
- Enables DynamoDB advanced features for the backup
- Creates a backup with 7-day cold storage transition, 97 day deletion period, and tags for tracking

Once the backup is completed successfully, the DynamoDB table is deleted. Savings unlocked â

# **A Numerical Example**

Letâs look at a typical scenario. A development team creates multiple DynamoDB tables during a three-month project. This can happen easily during a project, with different tables for dev, test, staging, prod, and various feature tables. After the project concludes, these test tables remain unused but provisioned. With 10 idle tables each provisioned with 100 RCUs and 100 WCUs (.

- Storage Cost: 10GB Ã $0.25 = $2.50 per month
- Provisioned Capacity:
  - Write Capacity Units (WCU): 100 WCU @ $0.00065 per WCU-hour

    100 WCU Ã $0.00065 Ã 730 hours = $47.45 per month

- Read Capacity Units (RCU): 100 RCU @ $0.00013 per RCU-hour

100 RCU Ã $0.00013 Ã 730 hours = $9.49 per month

- Monthly cost per table = $2.50 (storage) + $47.45 (WCU) + $9.49 (RCU) = $59.44 per table
- Total monthly cost ~ $600/month

With this CloudFix Finder/Fixer, rather than pay for the WCUs and RCUs, you pay the storage cost at the cold storage rate of $0.03/GB, or $0.30/month per table, for $3/month total. This is the difference between, say, a single espresso vs a [Rancilio Silvia Espresso machine](https://www.ranciliogroup.com/rancilio/silvia/). Maybe use 1 monthâs of savings to get one for the office!

# CloudFix Introduces Lambda Graviton Migration

Stephen Barr

October 28, 2024

![CloudFix Introduces Lambda Graviton Migration](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/graviton-4-saving.webp)

Are you looking to reduce your AWS Lambda costs while improving performance? CloudFix is excited to announce our new Lambda Graviton Migration Finder/Fixer, designed to automatically identify and migrate eligible Lambda functions to AWS Graviton architecture while upgrading outdated runtimes. **We are rolling out this feature over the next few weeks, so be sure to check your CloudFix dashboard!**

## The Graviton Success Story

The AWS Graviton journey has been remarkable to witness. Since the introduction of the first-generation Graviton processor in 2018, AWS and Annapurna Labs have maintained an impressive pace of innovation. The rapid evolution from Graviton2 to Graviton3, and now to the generally available Graviton4, demonstrates AWSâs commitment to ARM-based computing excellence.

Each new generation has delivered substantial improvements in price-performance ratio:

- Graviton2 offered up to 20% cost savings over x86
- Graviton3 brought 25% better compute performance than Graviton2
- Graviton4, released less than two years after Graviton3, delivers up to 30% better performance than Graviton3

This rapid iteration â with Graviton4 arriving just 18 months after Graviton3 â shows AWSâs aggressive push to lead the ARM-based cloud computing revolution.

For a deep dive into the latest Graviton 4 features, check out this with CloudFix CTO Rahul Subramanian and CloudFix Chief Evangelist Stephen Barr, hosts of AWS Made Easy.

## The Power of Graviton for Lambda

AWS Graviton processors, built on 64-bit ARM architecture, deliver significant performance improvements and cost savings compared to x86-based instances. When you migrate your Lambda functions to Graviton, you can expect:

- Up to 20% cost reduction
- Improved performance and efficiency
- Better price-to-performance ratio
- Enhanced energy efficiency

## Why Upgrade Now?

Many organizations are still running Lambda functions on older runtimes that are approaching their end-of-support dates:

- Node.js 14.x (December 4, 2023)
- Python 3.7 (December 4, 2023)
- Java 8 (January 8, 2024)
- Node.js 16.x (June 12, 2024)

Our new Finder/Fixer not only migrates your functions to Graviton but also automatically updates them to supported runtime versions, helping you stay ahead of deprecation deadlines.

## The CloudFix Lambda Graviton Migration Advantage

Our solution offers several key benefits:

1. **Automated Analysis**: We scan your AWS environment to identify Lambda functions that can benefit from Graviton migration and runtime updates.

2. **Intelligent Validation**: Our system performs comprehensive checks to ensure your functions are compatible with Graviton, including:
   - Runtime compatibility verification
   - Architecture-specific dependency analysis
   - Current resource utilization assessment
3. **Safe Migration**: The migration process is handled through AWS Systems Manager Change Manager, providing:
   - Complete audit trail
   - Rollback capabilities
   - Minimal risk to your applications
4. **Cost Optimization**: We target functions with significant cost impact, focusing on those with annual costs of $10 or more to maximize your ROI.


## How It Works

1. **Find**: CloudFix scans your Lambda functions to identify candidates for Graviton migration and runtime updates. We use a detailed set of evaluators to determine eligibility.

2. **Analyze**: We perform detailed compatibility checks and calculate potential savings.

3. **Validate**: Our system verifies that your functions donât use x86-specific libraries or binaries. This is similar to how the AWS Porting Advisor for Graviton works.

4. **Migrate**: With your approval, we:
   - Update the runtime to the latest supported version
   - Switch the architecture to arm64 (Graviton)
5. **Monitor**: Track the migration success and verify function performance.


## Real-World Impact

Letâs look at a practical example:

A Lambda function running on x86 with Python 3.7 and costing $1,000 annually can be:

- Upgraded to Python 3.11
- Migrated to Graviton
- Resulting in $200 annual savings

Have a look at this example in the CloudFix dashboard:

![Lambda Graviton Finder/Fixer](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/4095cf23-ebd0-4abc-af48-981d36e57e6d.png)

As yoou can see, each individual function doesnât save too much. But, there can be hundreds or thousands of these functions in a typical AWS account. In my personal AWS account, I have more than 50 that do various digital housekeeping tasks. Now multiply the potential savings across your entire Lambda function portfolio, and the savings become substantial! This is similar toÂ [unused elastic IP addresses](https://cloudfix.com/blog/remove-unused-aws-elastic-ip-addresses-cut-costs-improve-security/)Â â small individual savings but they add up fast!

## Getting Started

To take advantage of the Lambda Graviton Migration feature:

1. Log in to your CloudFix dashboard
2. Navigate to the Finders section, and go to Advanced
3. Look for the âLambda Graviton Migrationâ Finder
4. Review identified opportunities and potential savings
5. Using our newÂ `Create Tickets`Â button, you can create tickets for the migrations you want to implement. We will dive into the details of theÂ `Create Tickets`Â button in a future blog post.

## The Modernization Benefit

We are focused on the cost benefits of migrating to Gravton, but the modernization benefits are significant. With large AWS deployments, it is easy to have a Lambda function that just sits there and does its job, but has not been updated in years. By scanning all of your Lambda functions, you can identify these long-forgotten Lambda functions and make sure they are using the latest runtime version. Running a deprecated runtime may not be an issue in the short term, but ifÂ [Murphyâs Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)Â is any indicator, it will be an issue at the worst possible time.

## Conclusion

The CloudFix Lambda Graviton Migration Finder/Fixer offers a safe, automated way to modernize your Lambda functions while reducing costs. By combining runtime updates with Graviton migration, you can ensure your serverless applications are both cost-effective and future-proof.

# How to Master the Evolving Cloud Cost Optimization Landscape

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/bill-gleeson.jpeg)

Bill Gleeson

May 18, 2022

![How to Master the Evolving Cloud Cost Optimization Landscape](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Generic_footprint.png)

The unlimited agility, scalability, and technological evolution that cloud computing provides is undeniable. Riding the wave of innovation offered by AWS, Azure, and Google puts you at a distinct advantage over those who arenât yet bought in.

Like any IT solution, being cloud-native comes with a cost. But unlike other solutions, the cost of the cloud is variable, complex, and often unpredictable. The need for cloud cost optimization is evident, but many companies still struggle to keep their public cloud expenses under control. In this blog, weâll explore what separates cloud costs from on-premise costs, the cloud cost challenges everyone faces, and how cloud cost optimization is more than a âonce and doneâ exercise.

## The different nature of cost: public cloud versus on-premise

Managing and accounting for traditional IT infrastructure costs is relatively straightforward. Your Engineering team identifies their project requirements, presents them to Finance, and is assigned a capital budget. With on-premise costs, it is also easy to forecast your future expenses based on static requirements.

Conversely, cloud computing operates with an elastic âpay-as-you-goâ model â you scale up or down as needed, limiting the over- or under-provisioning of resources. That real-time flexibility is the big difference between on-premise and cloud-native, and is why migrating to the cloud is a high priority for so many digital enterprises.

> âBy 2025, cloud-native platforms will serve as the foundation for more than 95% of new digital initiatives â up from less than 40% in 2021.â

But that same flexibility presents a significant cloud cost management challenge: how do you predict and budget for ongoing expenses when they are driven by constantly changing resource requirements? If you have a spike in application user traffic one month, that is potentially a great thing from a business growth perspective. But that also equals a spike in your costs â something your finance team most likely didnât account for. By the time your AWS bill arrives, itâs too late.

## The evolving cost of the cloud

Recognizing the flexible nature of cloud costs is a good starting point, but thereâs another layer of complexity that many organizations havenât yet grasped. If youâre using AWS, each resource you launch often requires additional peripheral services and charges in order to run. A dollar isnât always just a dollar.

For example, depending on how you set up your NAT Instance of NAT Gateway, you will be charged per instance per hour, as well as for data transmission. Cloud cost optimization requires extensive knowledge and a multidimensional approach â something most organizations still lack.

In addition, the cloud landscape isnât locked in place. AWS has evolved beyond just compute and storage, releasing hundreds of new services and updates every year to build the operating system of the future â their goal is to continuously improve what customers are capable of doing on the cloud. This is excellent for digital enterprises, but it also means that potential cost optimizations are constantly missed.

Consider gp2 volumes, a cost-effective, general purpose cloud storage solution at their time of release. But then AWS created gp3 volumes, which provide higher performance at a lower cost. [Migrating from gp2 to gp3](https://cloudfix.com/blog/aws-gp3-ebs-volumes/) is just one example of an easy cloud cost optimization that has come from AWSâs constant evolution. Keeping up with every new service and update announcement is a full-time job, for which no engineering or finance team has the capacity. The frequent introduction of new instances or services means your cloud environment changes as AWS changes â continuous monitoring and action is therefore essential to remain as optimized as possible.

## How you can adapt to this new cloud cost environment

There is no way to 100% optimize your cloud costs. But you can make significant improvements with these simple steps:

- Follow the [AWS pillars of cost optimization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-laying-the-foundation/cost-optimization-pillars.html) to streamline your cloud environment
- Start with ballpark cost estimates and budgets â be realistic, and expect changes when you receive your bill
- Use billing and cost alerts to stay on top of actual costs and real-time spend
- Educate and train your team on cloud cost â establishing a [Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE)](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/execute-your-cloud-strategy-with-a-cloud-center-of-excellence) is a great way to get people proactively thinking about ongoing costs
- Use an automated cost optimization tool â using an automated solution like CloudFix is ideal for continuously identifying and realizing AWS cost savings, so your team can focus on growth and innovation

[Check out our other blogs](https://cloudfix.com/blog/) for AWS cost savings tips and cloud case studies or [see how CloudFix automatically executes savings from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5wc4rjxznjmwq) now.

_CloudFix scans, automates, and executes 100% safe, AWS-recommended account fixes for optimal cloud hygiene. With AWS issuing 50+ recommendations each week for performance and cost, CloudFix continually adds news fixes to its growing library to ensure you stay compliant with AWS recommendations. Each fix that enters CloudFixâs library must meet two criteria: 1) it is zero risk and (2) it offers no downtime. Reduce complexity and boost efficiency with CloudFix._

# CloudFix: Fix Your AWS Costs

CloudFix Team

February 25, 2021

![CloudFix: Fix Your AWS Costs](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Piggy-bank.png)

Talk to an AWS user, and theyâll tell you how wonderful it is to move to the cloud. Flexibility, convenience, saved time, and massive growth potential. Who doesnât like that?

Yet, more often than not, companies arenât equipped to move to AWS. Hearsay, lack of knowledge, and poor cost optimization lead to, you know itâlong AWS bills. But, you can stop that. You can save your $$.

We present to you _drumroll_âCloudFix. Brought to you by DevGraph.

CloudFix is an AWS Cost Optimization software made to save you time and money. Itâs safe, secure, and automated.

### How it all began

According to Gartner, cloud waste will reach $21 billion by 2021. The culprits are those pesky idle and oversized resources. You donât need them, but they happen. Like ink stains on a white shirt. These overprovisioned resources often cost you thousands of dollars. But how do you identify and optimize them without disrupting the remaining infrastructure? Itâs a catch-22.

And thatâs where our journey began. At [DevFactory](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/devfactory/), managing 40K+ AWS accounts was no walk in the park. Resource utilization was hard and inching towards becoming elusive. So, we did what most people do. We tried tools in the market.

These tools identified the underutilized resources but couldnât help us optimize them. Whatâs one to do in that situation? We attempted to optimize the resources manually. We chipped away for a long time and worried about affecting our AWS infrastructure. Exhausted, we decided to create our own toolâCloudFix.

### How CloudFix Works

CloudFix does one thing and does it well. It finds resources to optimize and fixes them for you. What you get is a clean, safe, and cost-optimized AWS environment.

### How to use CloudFix

1. **Create 2 IAM roles** CloudFix needs you to create 2 IAM roles with restricted API permissions. Thus, it stays out of other usersâ accounts and cannot change anything without your approval.
2. **Let finders work their magic** The sophisticated CloudFix finders identify cost-saving opportunities in your AWS accounts. These opportunities are AWS recommended and donât affect your infrastructure.
3. **Automated fixing, immediate $$$** Then comes the fixing. Automated fixers optimize your account with one single click. Say yes to immediate savings! You can automate, check every recommendation, or schedule at off-peak hours.

To manage the entire process, you get a clean CloudFix dashboard. It lets you track real savings and audits every action performed.

CloudFix is a zero-risk, non-disruptive tool built to scale. For every million dollars we spend on accounts, we recapture $150K in savings each week. We did the numbers too. This is a whopping 52% cost reduction on our AWS bills!

Having extensively tested CloudFix for our 40K+ accounts, weâre now offering it to you. Because you deserve savings and more time to shake the world with your ideas. If you love predictable savings, youâll love CloudFix.

This is what sets us apart. We deliver you repeated savings every single week. We grew with AWS. Weâve put in the time, learned lessons, failed, tried again, and ultimately succeeded.

### Our Offer For You

CloudFix is a one-stop AWS cost optimization solution. Itâs easy to use, non-disruptive, and secure. Curious to see how it works? [Try CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/demo/)

# Reduce AWS CloudTrail costs by de-duplicating trails

![Stephen Barr](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/stephen-barr_blog.jpg)

Stephen BarrPrincipal Architect and Technical Evangelist

April 24, 2023

![Reduce AWS CloudTrail costs by de-duplicating trails](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/FIxerBlogImage-1.png)

> I could go back in the direction I had come from, or I could go forward in the direction I intended to go.
>
> _â Cheryl Strayed, Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail_

In the 2014 movie [Wild](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/) (and the book that inspired it), Reese Witherspoonâs character hikes the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail) (PCT) in search of deeper meaning and personal growth. In the opening scene of the film, she throws her boots off of a mountainside in frustration because they werenât sized appropriately and werenât worth the added weight. (Fun story: the movie crew never found the boot, but [a hiker did a few months later](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3077234/Hiker-s-Reese-Witherspoon-s-hiking-boot-movie-Wild-place-left-film.html).)

![Reese Witherspoon portraying Cheryl Strayed in the 2014 movie. This is a still from the opening scene](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Reese-Witherspoon.jpg)

I can relate to this moment on a couple of levels. I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and have hiked parts of the PCT; I can attest that this trail is just as stunning as it looks. I also understand the impulse, on the trail or otherwise, to get rid of things that are weighing you downâ¦ which brings us to todayâs topic.

Like poorly-fitting boots, duplicate trails in AWS CloudTrail just arenât worth keeping around. While we canât exactly chuck redundant trails off a cliff, we can get rid of them (manually or easily and automatically) â and achieve significant AWS cost savings in the process.

## AWS CloudTrail: What it does, how it works, and why we use it

Before we dig in, letâs quickly review the basics. [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) is a service for monitoring and recording AWS API calls across the vast majority of AWS services, including EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, EBS, CloudFront, SQS and more. We use it to understand and audit the actions taken across AWS accounts. We also rely on CloudTrail for compliance purposes, to record logs for industry-specific or internal IT standards.

Within CloudTrail, there are several event types, including data events, management events, and Insights events. In this blog, weâll focus on management events, which broadly concern the creation, usage, and deletion of AWS resources. Creating an S3 bucket, for example, would be a management event.

You can aggregate and organize the events that CloudTrail monitors by creating trails. (These trails, unfortunately, arenât quite as lovely as the PCT. Far fewer conifers.) [According to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/how-cloudtrail-works.html), âa trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can create a CloudTrail trail to archive, analyze, and respond to changes in your AWS resources.â For instance, a trail that records network configuration changes can help make sure that your network is functioning as intended, or a trail that monitors the creation of S3 buckets can ensure that proper encryption policies are in place, which is particularly important to HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

In other words, trails allow teams to easily monitor a set of events within a pre-defined group of AWS services, all in one place and with useful metadata such as the event source, source IP address, and user identity.Â  Theyâre incredibly useful for providing an audit trail of exactly what is happening in an AWS account, but they can also drive up costs if youâre not careful how you use them.

## Why do we end up with duplicate AWS CloudTrail trails?

AWS CloudTrail can support multiple trails, including multiple trails that monitor some of the same events. This flexibility can be a good thing. It also makes it easy to create and pay for trails that end up being redundant. This is how cost overruns occur, and why weâre digging into this topic in the first place.

Say one IT administrator is interested strictly in S3 and EC2 usage, while another is tasked with complying with a particular standard, like HIPAA. They both create trails to meet their specific needs, but in the process, they may capture overlapping events.

This situation typically happens naturally due to lack of communication. Everyoneâs working in their own siloes, doing their own thing, and no one thinks about the fact that other people may be monitoring the same events. Itâs especially pronounced in large organizations, where disparate teams create CloudTrail trails to monitor their specific resources and events. The result: redundant trails, duplication of effort, and most importantly, increased costs that tend to go under the radar.

Thereâs another scenario in which IT teams acknowledge the overlap between trails, but do it anyway. Why? The argument is that having logically differentiated trails, like one trail for HIPAA and another for S3+EC2, makes it easier to review and comply with regulatory requirements. The logs live in their own easily accessible buckets, and the reduced complexity is worth the extra cost.

Is it worth it? We vote no. The primary purpose of CloudTrail logs is simply existing in case of an audit. Events are recorded in S3, so the owner of the AWS account is compliant. The end. For audit purposes, just proving that the data exists is enough. If the data really needs to be queried for some reason, we can use tools like Athena, ElasticSearch/Logstash/Kibana (the ELK Stack), DataDog, or Splunk. These tools are filtering data anyway, so separating some out for a particular audit isnât an issue.

**Useful aside: What to do instead of creating unique CloudTrail trails for each use case**

Instead of creating a variety of logically differentiated trails, we recommend having one large trail. The âmaster trailâ records all of the events you need to meet all of your requirements, which you can filter after the fact if necessary. By using the same trail as a data source for multiple dashboards and reports, you can really optimize your CloudTrail spend. Combine this with AWSâs free storage of the first copy of a management event, this approach can eliminate a large portion of your CloudTrail costs. Cheers to greater AWS cost savings.

In any event: whether you end up with duplicate CloudTrail trails because of a lack of communication or deliberate strategy, youâre paying way too much for them. CloudTrail records the events associated with a trail into corresponding log files in S3, and charges based on the number of recorded events in a trail. So, back to our example above, if IT admin #1 and IT admin #2 are recording the exact same set of events for different reasons, youâre paying for it twice â and overpaying for AWS is not how we roll.

## How much can you save by deactivating redundant AWS CloudTrail trails?

Just how much does it cost to support redundant versions of CloudTrail trails?

CloudTrail management events (the ones weâre interested in) cost $2.00 per 100,000 events delivered. At first glance, this seems trivial. But, loyal readers, weâve been here before! Just like many other AWS resources (looking at you, [elastic load balancers](https://cloudfix.com/blog/savings-remove-idle-elastic-load-balancers/) and [elastic IP addresses](https://cloudfix.com/blog/remove-unused-aws-elastic-ip-addresses-cut-costs-improve-security/)), the cost can scale endlessly, and endlessly scaling costs are never a good thing. Also, as mentioned above in our Useful Aside, the first copy of a management event is stored for free. If weâre clever about only storing one copy of an event, we can substantially reduce our costs.

Some of the most common CloudTrail management events are:

- EC2: `RunInstances, StartInstances, StopInstances, TerminateInstances`
- Lambda: ` CreateFunction, UpdateFunctionCode, DeleteFunction`
- RDS: `ModifyDBInstance, CreateDBSnapshot`
- SQS: `CreateQueue, DeleteQueue`
- CloudFormation: `CreateStack, UpdateStack, ValidateTemplate`
- S3: `CreateBucket`

These operations occur frequently in the course of managing a large AWS deployment and add up fast. In fact, one of our large customers had nearly $90K in annual CloudTrail management event spend. Of that, it turned out that **a full $74K â 82% â was redundant and could be eliminated**. While the numbers will change with every company, itâs clear that there are savings to be found here.

CloudTrail event costs are a large and complex topic. Read on to get deeper into the nitty gritty, then check out

this [AWS Knowledge Center article](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/remove-duplicate-cloudtrail-events). It provides additional details and recommendations about the cost of duplicate management events and the types of events that can drive up costs.

## A five-step process for manually deactivating redundant AWS CloudTrail trails

We know why itâs worth going after duplicate CloudTrail trails: theyâre costly and unnecessary. Actually deactivating them, however, isnât quite as simple.

Manually identifying which trails are redundant, determining which ones to deactivate, and then actually switching them off requires five steps:

1. List all the trails
2. Compare each pair of trails
3. For overlapping pairs, select a trail to deactivate
4. For each trail marked for deactivation, check for downstream consumers and take any appropriate actions
5. Deactivate the trail

![This is a process flowchart to show how we decide which trail to delete](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Diagram-Algorithm-to-eliminate-a-redundant-trail-min.png)

A five-step process for manually deactivating redundant AWS CloudTrail trails

### Step 1: List all the trails

The process starts out easy. We can use the [ListTrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_ListTrails.html) API call to â wait for it â list the trails. From the command line, use the AWS CLI to launch this command:

```bash
aws cloudtrail list-trails
```

Copy

AWS CloudTrails are associated with each region, so you need to run every step in this process for every region. You can get a list of regions with this command:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-regions --query 'Regions[].RegionName' --output text
```

Copy

Pro tip: for this process, we recommend using Python rather than a shell script. There are some complicated bits coming up with comparing trails, and you want to have the flexibility of a proper programming language at your fingertips. Hereâs how to list the trails in Python:

```python
import boto3

def list_trails_in_region(region_name):
    # Create a CloudTrail client for the specified region
    client = boto3.client('cloudtrail', region_name=region_name)

    # Call the list_trails method
    response = client.list_trails()

    # Extract the trail list from the response
    trails = response['Trails']

    return trails
```

Copy

## Step 2: Compare pairs of trails

This is why we wanted to use a proper programming language. Say we have trails A, B, C, D, and E. We need to list and compare every possible pair of trails. For this set, it would be {A,B}, {A, C}, {A, D}, {A, E}, {B, C}, {B, D}, {B, E}, {C, D}, {C, E}, and {D, E} â 10 different comparisons.

Here is the Python code for creating a list of pairs of all trails:

```python
# Given a list of trails, return a list of every possible combination of trails
def makeTrailCombinations(trails: List[Trail]) -> List[Tuple[Trail, Trail]]:
    trail_combinations = []
    for i, trail1 in enumerate(trails):
        for trail2 in trails[i + 1:]:
            trail_combinations.append((trail1, trail2))
    return trail_combinations
```

Copy

**âï¸ Math moment! âï¸**

The number of possible combinations grows fast! If youâre into card games (or somehow remember high school math), you may have come across this formula:

(nk)=n!k!(nâk)!.\\binom {n}{k} ={\\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}.(knâ)=k!(nâk)!n!â.

It is the number of unique subsets of size **k**, out of a group of size **n**. If you are interested in the number of possible 5-card hands from a deck of cards, **n=52** and **k=5**. For CloudTrail trails, **n** is the number of trails we have in a region, and **k** is 2, since we are comparing pairs of trails.

Once we have our list of pairs, we need to compare them against each other. First, get the events and properties associated with each trail with the API functions [DescribeTrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTrails.html), [GetTrailStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_GetTrailStatus.html), [GetEventSelectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_GetEventSelectors.html), and [GetInsightSelectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_GetInsightSelectors.html). Using these functions in your code allows you to get all of the information necessary to make the comparison.

When you have the sets of events and properties for each trail, you need to run a `compareTrails` function on each pair of trails.

The `compareTrails` function is where the heavy lifting happens. For a given pair of trails, it compares the set of events monitored and set of properties to determine if the two trails are capturing the same data.

The âouter loopâ of your code will then look like:

```python
# Get list of pairs of trails
my_pairs = makeTrailCombinations(my_trails)

# Iterate over list of pairs, compare each one
for (trail_a, trail_b) in my_pairs:
    result = compareTrails(trail_a, trail_b)
   # Based on result, take actionâ¦.
```

Copy

When we compare a set of trails against each other, there are a few different scenarios that can occur. Of course, if they have nothing in common with each other, theyâre not redundant and we keep them both. But if they do overlap, it can happen in three different ways:

1. Trail X and Trail Y partially overlap
2. Trail X and Trail Y are equivalent â exactly the same
3. One trail is a subset of the other

#### Scenario 1: Trail X and Trail Y partially overlap

With a partial overlap, the trails are monitoring some of the same events, but some events are unique to each trail. This means that we canât deactivate either one without possible downstream effects. Ideally, if you follow the Useful Aside above and just have one trail that accounts for every requirement, you wonât run into this issue, but for now, we keep them both. Visually, it would look like:

![This is a Venn diagram where X and Y overlap, but only partially.](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/X-Y-partial-overlap-min.png)

Who doesnât love a good old Venn diagram? You can thank us later.

So: partial overlap, no opportunity to deactivate duplicate trails. Scenarios 2 and 3, however, are where we can find our redundancies â and cut our costs.

#### Scenario 2: Trail X and Trail Y are equivalent

![This is a Venn diagram where X and Y completely overlap. This is showing the case where two trails are equivalent.](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/X-Y-full-overlap-min.png)

This means that they are monitoring the exact same set of events and have compatible properties. Lots of potential for duplication here, which means potential for savings!

#### Scenario 3: One trail is a subset of the other

![This is the case where Y is a subset of X, or in other words, X does everything Y does, and more.](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Y-subset-of-X-min.png)

This is our most complex scenario. For trail X to be a true superset of trail Y, it has to have an equal or larger scope in every respect, including the set of properties (check out the chart in the appendix for more detail). The potential for de-duplication here comes from the chance to get rid of the subset (smaller set).

Letâs look at a concrete example. Say we have a CloudTrail trail set up to monitor the CreateBucket and DeleteBucket management events.

Now, say your colleague down the (probably virtual) hall wanted to create a trail that monitored **_all_** management events, using the wildcard selector:

```python
ManagementEvents:
  - '*'
```

Copy

Your colleagueâs trail would capture the `CreateBucket` and `DeleteBucket` events just like your original trail, but would capture lots of other events as well. This new trail would be a superset of the old trail, so you would end up double paying for the `CreateBucket` and `DeleteBucket` events.

### Step 3: Select a trail to deactivate

Once weâve identified a pair of trails where one is redundant, we can reference our handy-dandy flow chart to choose which one to deactivate.

![Step 3 of the flowchart to show how we decide which trail to delete](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Step-3-Select-a-trail-to-deactivate-min.png)

For my non-visual learners, hereâs the decision-making framework:

- If the two trails are an exact match (scenario 2 above), first determine if either of the trails is part of a Control Tower. (A Control Tower is a framework for monitoring multi-account AWS environments. If a trail is part of a Control Tower, we know that itâs higher up the food chain and something depends on it.)
  - Is one of the trails part of a Control Tower? Flag the **other (non-Control Tower) trail** for deactivation.
  - Neither of the trails are part of a Control Tower? Flag the **newer** **trail** for deactivation.
- If the two trails are a superset or subset of each other (scenario 3 above), flag the **subset (smaller) trail** for deactivation. This ensures that we wonât lose any data.

### Step 4: Check on downstream consumers

There is one more wrinkle. When you eliminate a trail, even if the trails are redundant in the sense of the events that they are monitoring, they may have different downstream consumers, like dashboards.

Before you deactivate a trail, you need to make sure that the downstream consumers of the trail wonât be affected. In the case of a dashboard, this would require pointing the dashboard at a new source and modifying the selection/filter criterion to ensure that the incoming data remains the same. Itâs important to implement and test this _**before**_ you deactivate the trail.

Hereâs what this looks like in action:

[![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Redundant-Trails-and-Dashboards-min.png)](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Redundant-Trails-and-Dashboards-min.png)[![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/De-Duplicated-Trails-and-Dashboards-min.png)](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/De-Duplicated-Trails-and-Dashboards-min.png)

In the example above, Trail A is recording events for Lambda, Aurora, EFS, and Cognito. Trail B is recording data for just Lambda and Cognito. In this case, Trail A is a _**superset**_ of Trail B.

We can deactivate Trail B, since itâs redundant with Trail A; Trail A actually has **more** data than what is required for Dashboard B. Notice that we are using [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) to power both dashboards.

Since we are already using Athena, we can simply modify the query that powers Dashboard B to exclude the unnecessary data.

There are a variety of tools to process and visualize data in this way. Weâre partial to AWS native tooling like Athena and [QuickSight](https://cloudfix.com/blog/cut-amazon-quicksight-costs-removing-idle-users/), but if youâre a Splunk or Tableau shop, for instance, use what youâre comfortable with. The key takeaway is that there may be some modification required to the downstream consumers of the deactivated trail, and youâll need some tool to read the raw CloudTrail data from S3 and filter out unneeded events.

### Step 5: Deactivate the trail

To quote the inimitable Inigo Montoya, âlet me sum up.â You have listed all trails in a region, compared all the pairs of trails, identified redundant trails, checked for downstream users of the data, and made any necessary changes to ensure that all dashboards continue to operate. Give yourself a pat on the back.

Letâs finish the process like we started it: with a simple step. When all the steps above are complete, deactivate the trail with the [StopLogging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_StopLogging.html) command. We like StopLogging better than [DeleteTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTrail.html), because it can be reversed if you decide that you want to reactivate one of the trails. The syntax is:

```bash
aws cloudtrail stop-logging --name <trail-name>
```

## Automatically deactivate duplicate CloudTrail trails with CloudFix

CloudFix, of course, makes that very arduous process much, much easier.

With CloudFix, de-duplicating CloudTrail trails is almost completely automated. Notice we said âalmostâ; this is one of the rare occasions where itâs not strictly as simple as enabling the fixer, reviewing and approving the changes, and enjoying the savings. You still have to run step 4 yourself to check on downstream consumers.Â CloudFix, however, takes care of the rest.

Once your downstream consumers are squared away, just approve the savings opportunities CloudFix has identified. CloudFix will generate the change template and once you approve the changes, it will take care of deactivating the correct trail. The result: you remain in compliance without paying for the same event twice. Thatâs more money and time in your pocket â time enough, perhaps, to enjoy some real trails.

**Warp pipes**

_â the technical term for the green tubes/tunnels in the Super Mario world._

I recently saw the Super Mario Brothers movie with my family. We loved it! It was really fun seeing the iconic characters take on a whole new depth. At the beginning, Mario and Luigiâs adventures start when theyâre sucked into a warp pipe. The warp pipe, one of the green teleportation tubes that connect different worlds, separates the intrepid brothers and kicks off their journeys in the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond.

![A still image from the mario games, showing the warp pipes. We are using the warp pipes as a metaphor for VPCs which can connect bits of of virtual infrastructure](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/Mario-Warp-Pipes.png)

Welcome to the [warp zone](https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Warp_Zone)

If we think about AWS like the Mario Brothers universe, Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) would be the warp pipes and their endpoints would be the ends of the pipe, where you pop out or drop in. VPCs and their endpoints are an important part of the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that keeps bits and bytes flowing to the right places. They also, however, come with the potential to overspend. When we donât keep track of idle endpoints â the ones we no longer use â the costs add up.

Letâs take a closer look at why we end up with idle VPC endpoints, what itâs costing us, and how to save thousands of dollars every year by getting rid of them.

## The warp pipes of AWS: A quick overview of Amazon Virtual Public Clouds (VPCs)

Letâs start with the basics. With [Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html), you can define logically isolated virtual networks that contain your AWS infrastructure. Much like configuring routers, VPCs let you build and configure networks to your exact needs. This includes specifying IP address ranges, creating subnets, and configuring routing tables and network gateways. VPCs can span AWS availability zones within a region. With AWS PrivateLink, you can also connect directly to particular AWS services, on-prem networks via a VPN connection, or to other VPCs via a private IP address.

A VPC can contain EC2 instances, RDS instances, Lambda functions, and more. In addition, VPC _endpoints_ allow code running within the VPC to connect to the APIs for particular AWS services without using public IP addresses. There are three types of VPC endpoints:

1. [_Gateway endpoints_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/gateway-endpoints.html). Gateway endpoints allow the VPC to extend to include S3 and DynamoDB. They allow private traffic between these services and your VPC without any other infrastructure, keeping that traffic off of the public internet. There are no charges associated with gateway endpoints, so we can set them aside for the purposes of this conversation.
2. [_Gateway Load Balancer endpoints_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/gateway/getting-started.html). Gateway Load Balancers route traffic within the VPC to/from virtual appliances. Gateway Load Balancer endpoints (GWLBEs) connect Gateway Load Balancers to the rest of the VPC. In [AWSâs own words](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/gateway-load-balancer/), GWLBEs âconnect Internet Gateways, VPCs, and other network resources over a private connection. Your traffic flows over the AWS network, and data is never exposed to the internet.â These endpoint types incur an hourly charge regardless of usage, so we will be looking at these carefully.
3. [_Interface endpoints_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html). Interface VPC endpoints connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. For example, with Interface endpoints, you can access Amazon S3 directly from a VPC, without your traffic going over the public internet. Other powerful use cases include accessing RDS, Secrets Manager, or Lambda from a VPC. (You can see the full list of services that support Interface endpoints [here.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/choosing-your-vpc-endpoint-strategy-for-amazon-s3/)) Similar to GWLBEs, Interface endpoints incur an hourly charge, so we have to pay attention to their usage.

While each of these types of VPC endpoints supports a unique type of connection, they have one thing in common: itâs easy to rack up too many of them and spend too much on endpoints that you donât need.

## 3 reasons why idle VPC endpoints pile up

There are a few different ways that we end up with idle endpoints:

1. _Incomplete configurations_. During the development and testing process, itâs simple to create new resources. In fact, you often see infrastructure labeled `test-12-i-hope-this-works`, `test-13-delete-this`, `test-14-almost-got-it`, etc. Ideally, once the configuration stabilizes, itâs captured in a CloudFormation template or some other IAC solution. IAC creates resources as a logical group, and when the service isnât needed, it deactivates and deletes all of the associated resources at once. However, during testing, when you are creating resources on an ad-hoc basis, there is no mechanism to remind you to delete the associated resources. As a result, we end up with idle VPC endpoints.
2. _Retired services_. Services become deprecated over time. While weâre usually good at remembering to delete the more expensive resources associated with those services, like EC2 instances and RDS databases, we often forget the bits and pieces. (This happens with [Elastic Load Balancers](https://cloudfix.com/blog/savings-remove-idle-elastic-load-balancers/) and [Elastic IP addresses](https://cloudfix.com/blog/remove-unused-aws-elastic-ip-addresses-cut-costs-improve-security/), too.) Itâs just like in Mario Brothers. We make sure to get all of the ![Super Mario mushroom](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/super_mario_mushroom.png)s, but if weâre in a hurry, we skip some of the ![Super Mario coin](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/super_mario_coin.png)s. If only Mario had access to an automated tool like CloudFixâ¦ weâd be 1up-ing all day long.
3. _Orphaned resources / scaling down_. Itâs possible to delete VPCs and security groups without deleting the endpoints. This results in orphaned VPC endpoints that no longer serve a purpose.

It often happens during the scaling down process, when some of the infrastructure such as VPC endpoints remain. We donât need these endpoints, so thereâs no point in maintaining and paying for them.

All of these scenarios are becoming more common. As app deployments grow increasingly complex, the use of VPCs grows too. The result: more endpoints in general, more idle endpoints, and more opportunity to overspend.

## How much are idle VPC endpoints costing you?

Why does it matter if we have idle VPC endpoints floating around? Because weâre paying for something that we donât need, and thatâs never good business.

Letâs look at some numbers. GWLBEs and Interface endpoints are charged at a fixed hourly rate, as well as cost per petabyte. Hereâs the current pricing, as of May 2023 in `us-east-1`:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Category** | **Element** | **Cost** |
| Interface Endpoint | Fixed hourly | $0.01/hr |
| Interface Endpoint | First 1 PB | $0.01/GiB |
| Interface Endpoint | Next 4 PB | $0.006/GiB |
| Interface Endpoint | Anything over 5 PB | $0.004/GiB |
| Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint | Fixed hourly | $0.01/hr |
| Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint | Data charges | $0.0035/GiB |

This doesnât look like much at first glance, but over time and at scale, it adds up. Your idle VPC endpoints donât incur the data charges, but you are still paying the hourly charge. That amounts to approximately $90/year, per endpoint. That sounds like crumbsâ¦ but enough crumbs can create a serious mess (fellow parents will feel me here deeply.)

Think about it this way: if you got rid of 30 idle VPC endpoints every year, thatâs $2,700 back in your pocket. Thatâs almost three grand that you could reinvest into something far more valuable than idle endpoints, from additional AWS services to a retro arcade machine for the office (I vote for [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMm6NIhJFJ4).)

How much can your organization save by eliminating idle VPC endpoints? We typically find that between 5-10% of a companyâs average AWS spend comes from VPCs. Of that, about 5% (of the 5-10%) can be attributed to idle VPC endpoints. For 1M of annual AWS spend, thatâs $5K annually â more than enough for the Ninja Turtles.

## How to manually eliminate idle VPC endpoints

So, itâs clear how we end up with idle VPC endpoints and how much weâre paying for them (too much!) Now letâs see how to get rid of them. This process has three steps:

1. List all the VPC endpoints
2. Determine if the endpoints are idle
3. Delete idle VPC endpoints

### 1\. List all the VPC endpoints

The easiest way to list all of your VPC endpoints is to use the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR). To find them, we can use this query:

```sql
SELECT
  line_item_usage_account_id AS account_id,
  SUBSTRING(line_item_resource_id, POSITION('/' IN line_item_resource_id)+1) AS endpoint_id,
  line_item_product_code AS endpoint_product_code,
  line_item_operation AS endpoint_operation,
  SUM(line_item_unblended_cost)  AS data_charges
FROM <YOUR CUR DB>.<YOUR CUR TABLE>
WHERE
  product_region = 'us-east-1' -- replace with the region where your endpoints are located
  AND line_item_line_item_type LIKE  'Usage'
  AND line_item_product_code = 'AmazonVPC'
  AND line_item_operation LIKE 'VpcEndpoint'
  AND line_item_usage_start_date >= date_trunc('day', current_date - interval '31' day)
GROUP BY
  line_item_line_item_type,
  line_item_usage_account_id,
  line_item_resource_id,
  line_item_product_code,
  line_item_line_item_type,
  line_item_operation;
```

Copy

Notice that weâre searching the product code for `AmazonVPC` and for the operation `VPCEndpoint`. We can also look for the `CreateVPCEndpoint` or `CreateVPCEndpoints` operations if we want to drill down to exactly when the changes happened. This query will produce output which looks like the following table:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **account\_id** | **endpoint\_id** | **endpoint\_product\_code** | **endpoint\_operation** | **data\_charges** |
| 1234567890 | vpce-0123456789abcdef | AmazonVPC | VpcEndpoint | 12.34 |
| 2345678901 | vpce-abcdef0123456789 | AmazonVPC | VpcEndpoint | 23.45 |
| 2345678901 | vpce-eff9310123456789 | AmazonVPC | VpcEndpoint | 0.0 |

The VPC endpoint list that weâre looking for is in the endpoint\_id column in this table, with each identifier representing one endpoint. Now that we have those identifiers, we can figure out if theyâre idle.

### 2\. Determine if the endpoints are idle

Weâll continue to use the CUR to determine if the VPC endpoints are idle. Looking at the table, we already have the data we need. Remember from the pricing table that there is both a fixed hourly charge as well as a per/GiB charge. If thereâs no data going through, then there will be no data charges, and we can infer that the endpoint is idle.

### 3\. Delete idle VPC endpoints

We now have a list of endpoint\_idâs that arenât moving any data, so are almost certainly idle. Letâs use the [DescribeVpcEndpoints API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeVpcEndpoints.html) to check on the state of the endpoint. We can use the following command to query the VPC endpoints:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints \
    --vpc-endpoint-ids vpce-0123456789abcdef
```

Copy

The output of the command is given by this JSON response:

```json
{
    "VpcEndpoints": [\
        {\
            "VpcEndpointId": "vpce-0725b5d5bc12ac9ca",\
            "VpcEndpointType": "Interface",\
            "VpcId": "vpc-0d6ffa7d6cdd9dae9",\
            "ServiceName": "com.amazonaws.us-west-2.s3",\
            "State": "Available",\
            "PolicyDocument": "{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}",\
            "RouteTableIds": [],\
            "SubnetIds": [\
                "subnet-008085f956ef73dce",\
                "subnet-036c2b0227caea192",\
                "subnet-0f96d995b15cce2bf"\
            ],\
            "Groups": [],\
            "PrivateDnsEnabled": false,\
            "RequesterManaged": false,\
            "NetworkInterfaceIds": [\
                "eni-0f11a0b936dcfdf06",\
                "eni-08503bc0137bab266",\
                "eni-03e86c9bbc8b7de1d"\
            ],\
            "DnsEntries": [],\
            "CreationTimestamp": "2021-09-10T12:34:56.000Z",\
            "Tags": [\
                {\
                    "Key": "Name",\
                    "Value": "MyVPC-Endpoint"\
                }\
            ],\
            "OwnerId": "123456789012"\
        }\
    ]
}


```

Copy

Look at the state object.

Note that the `State` value is `Available`. The possible values of `state` are `PendingAcceptance`, `Pending`, `Available`, `Deleting`, `Deleted`, `Rejected`, `Failed`, and `Expired`. Those translate to:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **State** | **Meaning** |
| PendingAcceptance | The VPC endpoint is waiting for the owner of the service to accept the new VPC endpoint. |
| Pending | The VPC endpoint creation is in progress and it is not yet available for use. |
| Available | The VPC endpoint has been successfully created and it is now available and operational for use. |
| Deleting | The VPC endpoint is in the process of being deleted, but the deletion is not yet complete. |
| Deleted | The VPC endpoint has been deleted and is no longer available for use. |
| Rejected | The VPC endpoint was rejected by the service owner during the PendingAcceptance state and will not be created. |
| Failed | The VPC endpoint creation failed due to an error or issue, and it will not become available for use. |
| Expired | The VPC endpoint reached its expiration time and is no longer available for use. |

We can see that `Available` applies to VPC endpoints that are in use. There is no `InUse` state (although that would make things easier). We only use endpoints in the `Available` state because the other states imply that some sort of transition is taking place that we donât want to interrupt. Endpoints that are stuck in one of the other states should be cleaned up in the long term, but thatâs a task for another day.

Once we have a list of VPC endpoint identifiers, have validated that they have no traffic, and have used the `DescribeVpcEndpoints` to make sure that they are in an active state, we can delete them. To do this, use this command:

```bash
aws ec2 delete-vpc-endpoints --vpc-endpoint-ids vpce-0725b5d5bc12ac9ca
```

Copy

The command will produce the following output:

```json
{
    "Unsuccessful": [],
    "Successful": [\
        {\
            "VpcEndpointId": "vpce-0725b5d5bc12ac9ca"\
        }\
    ]
}
```

Copy

Endpoints that are successfully deleted will appear in the `Successful` array. Congratulations: youâre no longer paying for idle VPC endpoints.

## So long, human error: Eliminate idle VPC endpoints automatically with CloudFix

You could go through this very tedious process every month or so, but (a) itâs extraordinarily boring, (b) your engineers have more valuable ways to spend their time, especially given the relatively modest amount of savings, and (c) itâs extremely error prone. Looking through all those identifiers in the command line, running the commands, combing through the outputs, copying down all the VPC IDs, on and onâ¦ there are lots of opportunities to miss something or make a mistake. We are, after all, human.

You could also write your own automation. You have to use the command line tools to get the data, so while youâre in there, you might as well put a program together. That too, however, is far from foolproof. Your program would need to understand how to deal with errors at each step. Youâd need to retry something if it fails, report it back, surface the findings, and keep track of how often you did it. This is a classic case of what we call âundifferentiated heavy lift.â Itâs monotonous work thatâs prime to be outsourced.

Enter CloudFix. CloudFix makes it simple to get rid of idle VPC endpoints and reclaim that spend. We thoroughly developed and tested the _Cleanup Idle VPC Endpoints_ finder/fixer to minimize any risk. We prioritize not disrupting services that are in use by making sure that the VPC endpoints targeted for deletion havenât transferred any data in the past 31 days. We also built the automation to account for any errors and all the steps along the way. All you have to do is enable the fixer, evaluate and approve the changes, and start saving.

Take human error â and human effort â out of the equation. With CloudFix, youâll save just as many gold coins as Mario and Luigi, with a whole lot less effort. We call that a new high score in the game of AWS cost savings.

# Start small, save big: 3 steps to ongoing AWS cost savings

![Start small, save big: 3 steps to ongoing AWS cost savings](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/FinOps-Blog-Image2.png)

Overview:

- Itâs challenging to control AWS costs, but by starting small and building on your wins, you can spend less today and in the future.
- Step one: Identify and implement simple, non-disruptive fixes to save 10-15% with zero downtime.
- Step two: Invest in deleting your old code and replacing it with AWS managed services that deliver improved cost savings, innovation, and performance.
- Step three: Save 50% or more by rewriting products to be truly cloud native.

If your organization is anything like ours, your AWS bills continue to rise. Thereâs a good reason for that: AWS offers tremendous opportunities for innovation, modernization, and transformation, so we continue to expand how we take advantage of their services. Increased usage, however, comes with increased cost, and controlling AWS spend isnât easy or intuitive. With such a dynamic ecosystem that grows more complex every day, itâs incredibly challenging to stay ahead of every chance to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively.

That doesnât mean, however, that you can write off the effort â or that itâs impossible. As CTO of ESW Capital, I have relied on AWS since 2008. My team manages 40,000 AWS accounts across 150 enterprise software companies. Weâve been through the trenches of AWS cost optimization for 15 years and, with time and trial, have put systematic processes in place that control AWS costs consistently and reliably.

Our strategy: start small and build on your wins. By strategically reinvesting your savings at each stage, you can put in place an ongoing FinOps practice that reduces costs today and sets your business up for future success. Hereâs how we did it â and why it worked.

## Step 1: Save 10% with easy, AWS-recommended fixes

Every week, AWS releases 50-60 advisories in the form of [blog posts](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/blogs/aws/category/management-tools/aws-trusted-advisor/). These include recommendations for how to optimize AWS services for both performance and cost. AWS is generous with its knowledge, communication, and advice, but trying to keep up with every advisory is like standing in front of a firehose. Itâs a lot to take in at once.

> _The key here is to filter through this stream of information and identify the simple fixes that are non-disruptive to both the deployment environments and developer workflows._

Subscribe to the RSS feed to see whatâs relevant to your environment as well as easy and impactful. Alternately, look for a tool (like the one we built, called CloudFix) that keeps up with the advisories and implements the fixes automatically.

Examples of these quick and easy projects include:

- [Switching from gp2 to gp3](https://cloudfix.com/blog/migrate-gp2-to-gp3-better-performance-lower-costs/). AWS is completely upfront about the fact that gp3 is as performant as gp2 and, as a rule, 20% cheaper. They also make it seamless to switch from one type to the other. They donât, however, do it for youâ¦ and they do make gp2 the default volume type for most new EC2 instances. When you take the time to transition all of your volumes, though, you save 20% instantly on EBS.
- [Making AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering your default storage class](https://cloudfix.com/blog/aws-s3-intelligent-tiering-default-storage-class/). Over 90% of objects in S3 are accessed only once. Thatâs an incredible amount of wasted spend, and surely a reason that S3 is often in our customersâ top three AWS expenses. Simply switching to Intelligent-Tiering dramatically reduces those costs, even if you only use the first two layers of infrequent access. With S3 Intelligent-Tiering, there are no latency penalties, no retrieval charges, no minimum storage duration, and you can save 30-40%. The only catch: as with migrating to gp3, you have to physically go into every bucket and turn it on.
- [Archiving EBS snapshots](https://cloudfix.com/blog/cutting-aws-costs-ebs-volume-snapshot-archiving/). EBS snapshots pile up quickly and are complicated to delete thanks to their incremental nature. To solve this challenge, AWS introduced a low-cost storage tier called EBS Snapshots Archive. They also published very lengthy and dense documentation about how to ensure that you have picked the right snapshot candidates to archive, which is not particularly fun to parse, but can reduce EBS costs by up to 75%. If you donât pick the right candidates, you can pay as much as double your current costs. (This was one of the most complicated CloudFix fixers to build and Iâm particularly proud of it. [Read this blog](https://cloudfix.com/blog/cutting-aws-costs-ebs-volume-snapshot-archiving/) for a relatively simple explanation of how to go about archiving EBS snapshots manually or with CloudFix.)
- Turning off unused EC2 volumes. Some efforts are even simpler. For example, by turning off only six M4.xl instances, you can save $10k. Spend an hour, get $10,000 to invest in additional changes to your application (see step 2) to save even more.

Each of these fixes requires either some time and elbow grease or an automated way to securely make the changes. In either case, executing them will save you 10-15% on your overall AWS bill with zero risk or downtime. AWS has done the hard work, you just have to flip all the switches.

## Step 2: Save 30% by leveraging AWS managed services

Every company has a variety of home-grown solutions running in the background that theyâve built over the last 10-20 years. Originally, these tools met some specific use case, but today, most of this functionality is available as commodity services in the AWS catalog and are more reliable, scalable and performant than any homegrown solution. With the savings you achieved by running the quick-and-easy wins, you can invest in deleting your old code and replacing it with AWS managed services that deliver improved cost savings, innovation, and performance. .

While back-of-the-envelope math may make it seem as if managed services are more expensive, thatâs almost never the case. AWS managed services are highly scalable, reliable, and cost less to manage. All operational metrics are provided out of the box and all patching, bug fixing, maintenance, scaling, etc. is taken care of for you. That not only saves your team a huge amount of time and effort, it ensures that youâre always running the most up-to-date and secure version of that functionality. For higher order services too, like Amazon Rekognition, Personalize, and Forecast, it saves you the challenges of creating your own models and solutions for todayâs increasingly sophisticated requirements.

When it comes to managed services, you unlock real value when you identify patterns that allow you to stitch these services together to achieve outcomes that are 100x better than the old on-prem way of doing things.

Amazon Aurora is a great example of this. Across our 150 companies at ESW Capital, we used to have thousands of databases distributed across our accounts. Managing them and keeping track of them became an absolute nightmare. When we discovered Aurora, we decided to test it to its limits. We set up the largest Aurora cluster we could get and put all of our schemas on that cluster to see how well it would scale.

Most of our dev and staging instances barely clocked 1% in utilization, so a âbin-packingâ solution seemed like a smart way to consolidate these schemas on a single instance. We now have over 2,000 schemas on a cluster with four Db.R7g.16xl instances. By packing the schemas into a large database, each one gets significantly more resources to operate. The IOPS is fantastic, each schema has access to huge amounts of RAM, and every performance characteristic is better than using an individual tiny database. Plus, we no longer have 2,000 databases to maintain across all of our accounts. The marginal cost of adding a new database schema to our Aurora clusters: zero.

Another pattern that we have found incredibly valuable is our approach to BI solutions. Every enterprise product has some version of a dashboard/BI tool that allows its users to slice and dice their data. Using AWS managed services, we standardized our BI solution set across our product suite. We put data into an S3 data lake, use Athena to query the data as standard SQL, then use QuickSight dashboards that can be embedded into the applications. If the database requires more real-time querying capabilities, not a problem; we replace S3 with Spectrum or Redshift. This standard pattern saves every application hundreds of thousands of lines of code and takes just days for our team to implement into a new product.

The net-net:

> _There is no value in owning code that performs commodity operations. Using the managed service is not only more cost effective, but it is also more reliable, scalable, and performant._

## Step 3: Save 50%+ with true product rewrites

At ESW Capital, we frequently acquire products that were written 20-40 years ago. We decided that we would rebuild each of these products to be entirely cloud native. Then we went about it in entirely the wrong way.

Initially, we attempted to create feature parity between the old and new solutions. We spent over a million dollars at minimum each time, and we did not succeed even once. It just doesnât work to migrate old-school applications feature for feature to the cloud. These applications were created for a different paradigm and so much detritus builds up over the decades, itâs ridiculously hard to replicate, even if you wanted to.

We then changed our approach to creating a completely new cloud native solution based on the productâs true value proposition. We asked ourselves what core features made the customers love it and how we could recreate that using cloud-native solutions. Just like our approach to BI, there are patterns to be discovered here. In this case, we standardized on an OLTP stack based on Amazon DynamoDB, Cognito, AppSync, and Amplify to streamline and simplify operations.

> _The result: we reduced millions of lines of code to about 10,000 lines._

We only had to write schemas and permission policies. We ended up with all the standard CRUD operations with native support for custom fields in a more scalable, reliable, and elastic package â for about 1/10 the cost to deploy and run.

Of course, rewriting products is the final step for a reason. Even when you rely on managed services and repeatable processes, it takes time and resources. When you start small, however, and use your incremental savings to invest in more cost- and time-intensive projects like product rewrites, you ensure that you continue reducing costs while improving your business outcomes.

## Start small. Build momentum. Keep going. Save millions.

Using these steps, you can start gradually. Instead of going all-in with a brand new FinOps practice that promises to save 50% right out of the gate, you can get some easy wins. This creates momentum, gets leadership on board, and demonstrates measurable and incremental progress. It keeps everyone invested in the program, emotionally and financially, and prevents friction with dev teams that are asked to boil the ocean. AWS likes to say internally that teams should get 1% better every week. This approach is our version of that philosophy.

One last word: AWS cost optimization can never be a once-and-done activity. To succeed, it must be continuous, designed to build on itself and keep up with that firehose. Your teams are deploying new instances and tearing down old ones every day. AWS services, and the best practices around them, are constantly changing. The only way to stay on pace is by using repeatable processes and proven automation that can keep cost optimization running, day in and day out.

Is controlling AWS costs easy? No. Is it possible? 100%. Forget the ad hoc, open-heart-surgery projects and focus on ways to save today. Before you know it, that first $10k in savings will turn into millions.

# Bringing Cost Optimization to Your Teamâs Workflow with CloudFix JIRA Integration

At CloudFix, we are laser-focused on cost optimization, but we understand that most people are balancing the demands of cost optimization with many other responsibilities. Cloud resource owners are often on product- or service-oriented teams, and managing cost-optimization efforts is not a primary focus. Weâve built a Jira integration to make it easy for resource owners to implement cost-optimization efforts. With this integration, resource owners can see exactly what action they need to take, the justification for the action, and the cost savings. This integration makes it easier than ever to implement FinOps initiatives across your organization.

Letâs dive into the details and explore why we built this integration and how it works.

# The Challenge of Cost Optimization at Scale

In large organizations, cost optimization often follows a hub-and-spoke model. The centralized FinOps team is a hub, driving cost optimization initiatives across the organization. Various teams and individuals â the spokes â manage the actual resources while focusing on their specific applications and services. [![Centralized FinOps model](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/finops-3.svg)](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/finops-3.svg)

This structure can be highly functional. Centralized FinOps teams can push focused initiatives, and the resource owners can implement them and act as a knowledge source. For example, a company may have best practices for using Graviton. Some widely used internal code may exist, and Central FinOps would want to ensure this code is Graviton-compatible before advocating a FinOps rollout. This function is much better accomplished centrally than by each team.

The difficulty with this model is that Central FinOps are not the resource owners. They donât know the exact needs of any particular resource. Thus, it falls to the resource owners to implement the changes. These resource owners may have some incentive to optimize cost, e.g., through chargebacks, but ultimately, it is one initiative among many.

So, how can we make it easier for resource owners to implement cost-optimization efforts? The CloudFix Jira integration aims to provide them with the technical and financial information they need to make the right decisions.

## CloudFix JIRA Integration in Action

![Create Jira tickets from CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cf-interface-arrow.png)

Our JIRA integration bridges the gap between cost optimization insights and team workflows. Hereâs how it works:

1. When CloudFix identifies a cost optimization opportunity, instead of directly executing the finder-fixer, users can click âCreate JIRA ticket.â
2. A ticket is automatically created and assigned to the appropriate resource owner.
3. The ticket contains comprehensive information about the recommendation.

![CloudFix Jira ticket](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/cf-jira-ticket-arrow.png)

For example, when CloudFix identifies an opportunity to optimize EBS provisioning, the JIRA ticket includes:

- Specific configuration changes (e.g., âReduce provisioned IOPS from 16,000 to 3,000â)
- Historical utilization data demonstrating performance impact analysis
- Precise cost savings calculations (e.g., â$1,082 annual savingsâ)
- Resource ownership information via AWS tags
- Implementation guides and documentation
- AWS account and region details for context

# The Right Information at the Right Time

Producing âalertsâ about the many things you could optimize as a resource owner is easy. We could email you 10, 20, or 100 things per day! Some of them may be relevant, and some may not. However, if we did this, you would experience the dreaded âalert fatigue,â the actionable recommendations would be lost in the noise.

Other fields, from healthcare to aviation, have had the issue of âalert fatigue.â In a story from the book [Digital Doctor](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Doctor-Hope-Medicines-Computer/dp/1260019608), author Robert Wachter compares the usage of alerts in aviation to healthcare. He discusses how many doctors and nurses are overwhelmed by the sheer number of alerts and accidentally tune out the important ones. The author discussed with famous pilot Chesley âSullyâ Sullenberger, who described how alerts in an airplaneâs many systems are routed to the cockpit:

> The warnings in cockpits now are prioritized so you donât get alarm fatigue,â he told me. âWe work very hard to avoid false positives because false positives are one of the worst things you could do to any warning system. It just makes people tune them out. â âDigital Doctorâ by Robert Wachter

Similarly, our JIRA integration doesnât just dump information â it presents cost optimization opportunities in a clear, actionable format that fits into existing workflows. Just as modern cockpits prioritize warnings to avoid alarm fatigue, weâve carefully designed our tickets to provide:

- Clear, actionable information
- Relevant context and data
- Direct links to implementation resources
- Appropriate priority levels

##### Optimize Athena to use Glue and S3 Partitioning

# Cut Your S3 GetObject Costs in Half

Stephen Barr

December 12, 2024

![Cut Your S3 GetObject Costs in Half](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/robot-partitioning.webp)

Are your Amazon Athena queries costing more than they should? CloudFixâs latest Finder/Fixer helps you automatically identify situations where AWS Glue tables /could/ be optimzed based on the structure of the S3 bucket data, using S3 bucket partitioning, but currently are not. It then shows you how much you could save by fixing your Athena queries to take better advantage of the partitioning which is already in place. Letâs have a look at how it works.

# Athena, Glue, S3 Inventory, and S3 Bucket Partitioning

Before we dive into the Finder/Fixer, letâs have a look at the components involved in this process. The key components are:

- **S3**: AWSâs object storage service.
- **Athena**: The query engine used to analyze data stored in S3.
- **Glue**: AWSâs metadata catalog and ETL service that acts as a bridge between S3 and Athena. It creates and manages table definitions that tell Athena how to interpret data stored in S3, including critical information about data structure, format, and partitioning schemes.
- **S3 Inventory**: The process of collecting metadata about objects stored in S3.
- **S3 Bucket Partitioning**: The practice of organizing S3 objects into logical partitions based on attributes like date, category, or user.

The following diagram shows how these components interact:

![Service relationship diagram](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/svcs-relationship-diagram.png)

At the core of everything is S3. It is one of AWSâ oldest services. S3 stores files differently to a filesystem. Unlike traditional filesystems with hierarchical directories, an S3 bucket is essentially a flat collection of objects. However, S3 introduces the concept of âprefixesâ which create a folder-like structure using the â/â character in object names.

When S3 tools filter objects, they match these prefixes rather than traversing an actual directory structure. For example, in the pathÂ `s3://my-data/2024/12/13/daily-report.csv`, each segment separated by â/â is simply part of the objectâs key name, not a true folder hierarchy. A more effective approach for data organization is to explicitly label these segments as partition keys, such asÂ `s3://my-data/year=2024/month=12/day=13/daily-report.csv`.

## Bucket Partitioning Example

Assume you had a bucket with 10 years of data, 100 GB per year. The SQL approach would be to query this data like this:

![](https://cloudfix.com/wp-content/uploads/select-code-snippet.png)

Without partitioning, this query would scan the entire 10 years of data, which is 1TB. In order to execute this query, the entire S3 bucket would be scanned. Note that S3 charges $0.0004 per 1,000 GET requests and $0.0025 per GB of data scanned. You definitely donât want to scan all of your data if you know you really only need 10%.

Databases solved this problem long ago by using indexing. Indexing is a way that databases can quickly navigate through data associated with a particular column, e.g. a date.

Going back to the example above, if your S3 bucket is using keys which suggest a partitioning strategy, AND Glue is setup to use this partitioning strategy, then Athena can use this partitioning strategy to scan only the relevant data. Glue catalogs the partitions and their locations and provides partition metadata to query engines (like Athena).

Here is a visual diagram of how this works:

# Introducing the S3 Bucket Partitioning Finder/Fixer

CloudFixâs new S3 Bucket Partitioning Finder/Fixer automatically identifies S3-backed Glue tables which /could/ be using S3 bucket partitioning, but currently are not.

## How It Works

This CloudFix Finder/Fixer focuses on the Finder phase, as the fix may be specific to how you want your data organized. To identify potential opportunities, the Finder/Fixer:

- Finds all S3 buckets which are used with Glue tables (using CUR queries)
- Verifies that S3 Inventory is enabled for the bucket
- Using the list of objects from S3 Inventory, we use AI to detect existing logical partitioning patterns, such as:
  - Date-based partitioning (YYYY/MM/DD)
  - Category-based organization
  - User-based structuring
  - Hybrid approaches
- Check that the Glue table is not using the partitioning strategy
- Calculate potential savings by implementing the partitioning strategy in the glue table
- Recommend next steps for fixing

## AI Partitioning Strategy Detection

The AI is used to detect the partitioning strategy by analyzing the list of objects in the bucket. This is why we need S3 Inventory to be enabled for the bucket. AI is great for this purpose because it can quickly identify patterns in the data. We are currently usingÂ [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet "https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet")Â to detect the partitioning strategy, powered byÂ [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/ "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/")!

# Key Advantages

1. **Cost Optimization**: Reduce Athena query costs by scanning only relevant data partitions
2. **Performance Improvement**: Faster query execution through efficient data filtering
3. **Zero Risk**: There is no risk of losing your data or changing your query behavior.
4. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Intelligent detection of optimal partitioning strategies
5. **Automated Discovery**: Continuous monitoring for optimization opportunities

# Getting Started

To take advantage of this new Finder/Fixer:

1. Ensure S3 Inventory is enabled for your buckets (CloudFix has a separate Finder/Fixer for this!)
2. Review the identified optimization opportunities in your CloudFix dashboard
3. Implement the recommended partitioning strategies through your AWS Glue tables

## Looking Ahead

While this Finder/Fixer currently focuses on recommending partitioning strategies, weâre excited about future enhancements, especially with AWSâs recent announcement of queryable object metadata for S3 buckets. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve our cost optimization capabilities.
