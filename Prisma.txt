- [Deploy to Render](orm/prisma-client/deployment/traditional/deploy-to-render): This guide explains how to deploy a Node.js server that uses Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL to Render.
- [Traditional servers](orm/prisma-client/deployment/traditional/index): If your application is deployed via a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider, whether containerized or not, it is a traditionally-deployed app. Common deployment examples include Heroku and Koyeb.
- [Prisma Client](orm/prisma-client/index): In this section
- [Observability & logging](orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/index): In this section
- [Logging](orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/logging): Use the PrismaClient log parameter to configure log levels , including warnings, errors, and information about the queries sent to the database.
- [Metrics](orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/metrics): Prisma Client metrics give you a detailed insight into how Prisma Client interacts with your database. You can use this insight to help diagnose performance issues with your application.
- [OpenTelemetry tracing](orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/opentelemetry-tracing): Tracing provides a detailed log of the activity that Prisma Client carries out, at an operation level, including the time taken to execute each query. It helps you analyze your application's performance and identify bottlenecks. Tracing is fully compliant with OpenTelemetry, so you can use it as part of your end-to-end application tracing system.
- [Aggregation, grouping, and summarizing](orm/prisma-client/queries/aggregation-grouping-summarizing): Prisma Client allows you to count records, aggregate number fields, and select distinct field values.
- [Case sensitivity](orm/prisma-client/queries/case-sensitivity): Case sensitivity affects filtering and sorting of data, and is determined by your database collation. Sorting and filtering data yields different results depending on your settings:
- [Computed fields](orm/prisma-client/queries/computed-fields): Computed fields allow you to derive a new field based on existing data. A common example is when you want to compute a full name. In your database, you may only store the first and last name, but you can define a function that computes a full name by combining the first and last name. Computed fields are read-only and stored in your application's memory, not in your database.
- [CRUD](orm/prisma-client/queries/crud): This page describes how to perform CRUD operations with your generated Prisma Client API. CRUD is an acronym that stands for:
- [Custom models](orm/prisma-client/queries/custom-models): As your application grows, you may find the need to group related logic together. We suggest either:
- [Custom validation](orm/prisma-client/queries/custom-validation): You can add runtime validation for your user input for Prisma Client queries in one of the following ways:
- [Excluding fields](orm/prisma-client/queries/excluding-fields): By default Prisma Client returns all fields from a model. You can use select to narrow the result set, but that can be unwieldy if you have a large model and you only want to exclude a small number of fields.
- [Filtering and Sorting](orm/prisma-client/queries/filtering-and-sorting): Prisma Client supports filtering with the where query option, and sorting with the orderBy query option.
- [Full-text search](orm/prisma-client/queries/full-text-search): Prisma Client supports full-text search for PostgreSQL databases in versions 2.30.0 and later, and MySQL databases in versions 3.8.0 and later. With full-text search (FTS) enabled, you can add search functionality to your application by searching for text within a database column.
- [Queries](orm/prisma-client/queries/index): In this section
- [Pagination](orm/prisma-client/queries/pagination): Prisma Client supports both offset pagination and cursor-based pagination.

- [Select fields](orm/prisma-client/queries/select-fields): Overview
- [Transactions and batch queries](orm/prisma-client/queries/transactions): A database transaction refers to a sequence of read/write operations that are guaranteed to either succeed or fail as a whole. This section describes the ways in which the Prisma Client API supports transactions.
- [Custom model and field names](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/custom-model-and-field-names): The Prisma Client API is generated based on the models in your Prisma schema. Models are typically 1:1 mappings of your database tables.
- [Database polyfills](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/database-polyfills): Prisma Client provides features that are typically either not achievable with particular databases or require extensions. These features are referred to as polyfills. For all databases, this includes:
- [Connection management](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-management): PrismaClient connects and disconnects from your data source using the following two methods:
- [Connection pool](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-pool): The query engine manages a connection pool of database connections. The pool is created when Prisma Client opens the first connection to the database, which can happen in one of two ways:
- [Database connections](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/index): Databases can handle a limited number of concurrent connections. Each connection requires RAM, which means that simply increasing the database connection limit without scaling available resources:
- [Configure Prisma Client with PgBouncer](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/pgbouncer): An external connection pooler like PgBouncer holds a connection pool to the database, and proxies incoming client connections by sitting between Prisma Client and the database. This reduces the number of processes a database has to handle at any given time.
- [Configuring error formatting](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/error-formatting): By default, Prisma Client uses ANSI escape characters to pretty print the error stack and give recommendations on how to fix a problem. While this is very useful when using Prisma Client from the terminal, in contexts like a GraphQL API, you only want the minimal error without any additional formatting.
- [Generating Prisma Client](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client): Prisma Client is a generated database client that's tailored to your database schema. By default, Prisma Client is generated into the node_modules/.prisma/client folder, but we highly recommend you specify an output location.
- [Setup & configuration](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/index): This section describes how to set up, generate, configure, and instantiate PrismaClient , as well as when and how to actively manage connections.

- [Read replicas](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/read-replicas): Read replicas enable you to distribute workloads across database replicas for high-traffic workloads. The read replicas extension, @prisma/extension-read-replicas, adds support for read-only database replicas to Prisma Client.
- [Composite types](orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/composite-types): Composite types are only available with MongoDB.
- [Fields & types](orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/index): This section covers various special fields and types you can use with Prisma Client.
- [Null and undefined](orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/null-and-undefined): In Prisma ORM, if undefined is passed as a value, it is not included in the generated query. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and data loss. In order to prevent this, we strongly recommend updating to version 5.20.0 or later to take advantage of the new strictUndefinedChecks Preview feature, described below.
- [Working with compound IDs and unique constraints](orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/working-with-composite-ids-and-constraints): Composite IDs and compound unique constraints can be defined in your Prisma schema using the @@id and @@unique attributes.
- [Working with Json fields](orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/working-with-json-fields): Use the Json Prisma ORM field type to read, write, and perform basic filtering on JSON types in the underlying database. In the following example, the User model has an optional Json field named extendedPetsData:
- [Working with scalar lists](orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/working-with-scalar-lists-arrays): Scalar lists are represented by the [] modifier and are only available if the underlying database supports scalar lists. The following example has one scalar String list named pets:
- [Testing](orm/prisma-client/testing/index): This section describes how to approach testing an application that uses Prisma Client.
- [Integration testing](orm/prisma-client/testing/integration-testing): Integration tests focus on testing how separate parts of the program work together.
