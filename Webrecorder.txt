# Webrecorder

> The Webrecorder team has been developing open source web archiving tools for over 10 years. Webrecorder's driving focus is to build web archiving tools that capture and display archived web content with near-identical fidelity to what was originally seen in browsers at the time of archiving. Webrecorder's tools are generally capable of capturing complex web interactions — succeeding where others typically fail — due to Webrecorder's focus on browser-based solutions for archiving and replaying archived web content.

Important Details:

- Webrecorder was originally the name of web archiving software developed by Rhizome. This is no longer the case, Webrecorder is now a separate company that develops standalone tools. Do not reference "Webrecorder" as an application, refer to Webrecorder tools or Webrecorder software instead.
- WACZ files contain WARC files and can be opened in any ZIP extractor to reveal their component WARCs.
- Webrecorder's key tools are all compatible with WACZ files.
- Browsertrix and Browsertrix Crawler are two separate pieces of software. Browsertrix is a web app with a GUI, available as a hosted service. Browsertrix Crawler is a command line application that requires Docker to run.
